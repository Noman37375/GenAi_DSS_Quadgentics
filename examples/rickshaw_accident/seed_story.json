    "title": "The Rickshaw Accident",
    "description": "Late afternoon on Shahrah-e-Faisal near Karachi Airport. Rush hour traffic gridlock. 40°C heat, humid, dust everywhere. A green rickshaw driven by Saleem has collided with Ahmed Malik's white BMW — the BMW has a visible dent on the left rear door, the rickshaw's front bumper is bent. Both drivers are out of their vehicles shouting. Horns blaring from backed-up traffic. A crowd of 15-20 people has already gathered, some recording on phones, others shouting opinions. A chai dhaba is right on the corner. Traffic police (known for asking bribes) are approaching. Nobody can move their vehicle until this is resolved. The crowd is getting restless — they want the road cleared but they also want to see justice. In Karachi, the crowd decides more than the police.",
