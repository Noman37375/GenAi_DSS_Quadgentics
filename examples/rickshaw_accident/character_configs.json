            "name": "Saleem",
            "description": "Poor rickshaw driver, sole earner for family of 5. Drives an old green rickshaw — it's his entire livelihood. Speaks street Urdu with some English words, uses 'bhai', 'yaar', 'sahab'. Panicked and desperate after his rickshaw's front bumper bent in a collision with a white BMW. Will get emotional — can cry, sit on the ground, beat his chest, appeal to the crowd for support. Knows that in Karachi, the crowd usually sides with the poor man. Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate — might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move.",
            "goals": ["Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs", "Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded", "Get the crowd on his side", "Get back to work to feed his family"],

            "name": "Ahmed Malik",
            "description": "Successful businessman, late for international flight to Dubai. Drives a white BMW which now has a dent on the left rear door. Speaks formal English-Urdu mix. Impatient, entitled, but increasingly nervous because the crowd is growing and hostile toward him. Knows that in Karachi, a rich man surrounded by an angry crowd is in a vulnerable position. His BMW is physically blocked by the rickshaw and the crowd — he CANNOT just drive away. His real fear is not the damage cost but being stuck here while his flight leaves. Will try to use money and authority to escape the situation quickly.",
            "goals": ["Escape this situation as fast as possible", "Get to the airport before his flight leaves", "Not appear weak in front of the crowd", "Minimize the money he has to pay"],
            "inventory": ["smartphone", "business card", "wallet with credit cards and cash", "BMW car keys", "passport and boarding pass"]

            "name": "Constable Raza",
            "description": "15-year traffic police veteran posted on Shahrah-e-Faisal. Underpaid, cynical, and corrupt — but not stupid. Arrived at the scene of a rickshaw-BMW collision. Sees both parties as sources of income. Speaks blunt street Urdu — does NOT use polite words like 'facilitation fee', just directly asks for money or threatens consequences. Will physically take keys or papers as leverage. Is nervous about people recording on phones — doesn't want a viral video of him taking a bribe. Knows how to play both sides. May threaten to impound the rickshaw or write a challan to pressure both parties.",
            "goals": ["Extract maximum money from the situation", "Clear the traffic jam before his senior notices", "Avoid being recorded taking a bribe", "Maintain control of the scene"],
            "inventory": ["traffic challan book", "whistle", "police ID badge", "old phone"]

            "name": "Uncle Jameel",
            "description": "Local shopkeeper whose shop is right on the corner where the accident happened. 60 years old, been on this street for 30 years. Witnessed the rickshaw hitting the white BMW. Extremely nosy, loves being involved in drama, gives unsolicited advice loudly. Speaks thick Urdu with dramatic flair. Physically inserts himself into situations — stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone — 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone.",
            "goals": ["Be the one who resolves this situation", "Protect Saleem as a fellow common man", "Show off his connections and importance", "Keep the drama going as long as it entertains him"],
            "inventory": ["shop keys", "phone", "chai (can send helper to bring more)", "cash register nearby"]
