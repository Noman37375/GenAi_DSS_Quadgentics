    "description": "Late afternoon on Shahrah-e-Faisal near Karachi Airport. Rush hour traffic gridlock. 40\u00c2\u00b0C heat, humid, dust everywhere. A green rickshaw driven by Saleem has collided with Ahmed Malik's white BMW \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the BMW has a visible dent on the left rear door, the rickshaw's front bumper is bent. Both drivers are out of their vehicles shouting. Horns blaring from backed-up traffic. A crowd of 15-20 people has already gathered, some recording on phones, others shouting opinions. A chai dhaba is right on the corner. Traffic police (known for asking bribes) are approaching. Nobody can move their vehicle until this is resolved. The crowd is getting restless \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they want the road cleared but they also want to see justice. In Karachi, the crowd decides more than the police.",
