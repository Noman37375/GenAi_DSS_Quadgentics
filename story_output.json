    "description": "Late afternoon on Shahrah-e-Faisal near Karachi Airport. Rush hour traffic gridlock. 40\u00c2\u00b0C heat, humid, dust everywhere. A green rickshaw driven by Saleem has collided with Ahmed Malik's white BMW \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the BMW has a visible dent on the left rear door, the rickshaw's front bumper is bent. Both drivers are out of their vehicles shouting. Horns blaring from backed-up traffic. A crowd of 15-20 people has already gathered, some recording on phones, others shouting opinions. A chai dhaba is right on the corner. Traffic police (known for asking bribes) are approaching. Nobody can move their vehicle until this is resolved. The crowd is getting restless \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they want the road cleared but they also want to see justice. In Karachi, the crowd decides more than the police.",

Ahmed Malik, looking increasingly flustered, wipes sweat from his brow with a silk handkerchief. He\u2019s glancing repeatedly at his watch. The bribe money, discreetly offered, feels warm in Constable Raza\u2019s hand, but the sight of a phone camera pointed his way makes his gut clench. He needs to control this, and fast. He strides forward, deliberately blocking Ahmed Malik\u2019s path, and addresses the crowd with a practiced air of authority, though his voice is rough. \n\n\u201c*Aiye, aiye!* Enough noise! Let the police do their job! This is causing a major traffic jam. Both parties are at fault. *Saab*, you were driving too fast. And you,\u201d he glares at Saleem, \u201cyou should have looked before pulling into traffic! Now, both of you listen to me. We can settle this quickly, or we can spend all day here in this heat. A challan for both of you will be\u2026 expensive. Very expensive. Or\u2026 we can discuss a small *muawaza* \u2013 a compensation \u2013 to cover the inconvenience. For everyone.
