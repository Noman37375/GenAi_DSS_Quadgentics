    "description": "Late afternoon on Shahrah-e-Faisal near Karachi Airport. Rush hour traffic gridlock. 40\u00c2\u00b0C heat, humid, dust everywhere. A green rickshaw driven by Saleem has collided with Ahmed Malik's white BMW \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the BMW has a visible dent on the left rear door, the rickshaw's front bumper is bent. Both drivers are out of their vehicles shouting. Horns blaring from backed-up traffic. A crowd of 15-20 people has already gathered, some recording on phones, others shouting opinions. A chai dhaba is right on the corner. Traffic police (known for asking bribes) are approaching. Nobody can move their vehicle until this is resolved. The crowd is getting restless \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they want the road cleared but they also want to see justice. In Karachi, the crowd decides more than the police.",

Ahmed Malik\u2019s offer of ten thousand rupees hung in the air like a challenge. The crowd, initially a chaotic murmur, had begun to coalesce into distinct factions. A group of young men, sporting faded cricket jerseys, were openly filming the scene on their phones, narrating a running commentary for their social media feeds. A woman in a brightly colored shalwar kameez was fanning herself with a newspaper, occasionally shouting, \u201cShameful! Absolutely shameful!\u201d Just as Constable Raza was about to speak, a battered Suzuki Mehran, attempting to squeeze through a gap that didn\u2019t exist, clipped the rear fender of Ahmed Malik\u2019s BMW \u2013 a small, almost insignificant bump, but enough to draw a collective gasp from the crowd. Uncle Jameel, seizing the moment, pushed his way to the front, nearly knocking over a chai wallah balancing a tray of steaming glasses. He planted himself squarely between Ahmed Malik and Saleem, arms outstretched like a traffic barrier. A bead of sweat trickled down his forehead, and he adjusted his lungi with a flourish. \u201cAcha! Achcha! Now look what\u2019s happened! Another one! This Malik sahib\u2026 he brings bad luck! This is a conspiracy, I tell you! A conspiracy!\u201d",

A swarm of flies buzzed around a discarded mango peel near Saleem\u2019s rickshaw. Just as Ahmed Malik finished his offer of ten thousand rupees, a shrill whistle cut through the cacophony. Constable Raza\u2019s walkie-talkie crackled to life. He swore under his breath, quickly adjusting his uniform cap. The voice on the other end was his station commander, Inspector Khan, known for his unpredictable temper and zero tolerance for traffic snarls. \u201c\u2026Raza! Report! Shahrah-e-Faisal is a parking lot! I have the DIG on the line breathing down my neck! Get that mess cleared *now*! And Raza\u2026 no funny business. I\u2019ve heard whispers.\u201d Raza\u2019s face darkened. He glanced at the crowd, their phone cameras still trained on him. This wasn\u2019t just about a bribe anymore; it was about keeping his job. He needed to appear decisive, to *look* like he was in control. He turned back to the arguing men, his voice regaining its gruff authority. \u201cOkay, okay, enough! This is getting us nowhere. Malik sahib, your offer is\u2026 noted. But we need to follow procedure. And rickshaw wala, stop yelling! You\u2019re making things worse for yourself.\u201d He pointed a thick finger at Saleem. \u201cShow me your registration.

Uncle Jameel was directing traffic with his arms, simultaneously shouting instructions and trying to get a chai wallah to deliver tea to the \u2018important people\u2019 \u2013 meaning himself and anyone who looked like they might offer a good story later. Constable Raza, sweating profusely, was attempting to look authoritative while discreetly wiping his brow with a handkerchief. Then, a new sound cut through the din: a high-pitched wail. A woman, dressed in a simple salwar kameez, pushed her way through the crowd, sobbing uncontrollably. She pointed a trembling finger at the motorcycle now lying on its side near the BMW, its front wheel twisted at an unnatural angle. \u201cYeh meri roti hai!\u201d she cried, \u201cThis is my livelihood! My husband\u2026 he delivers medicines! Now what will we do?\u201d Saleem, seeing the woman\u2019s distress, felt a surge of desperate energy. He hadn\u2019t even noticed the motorcycle before, too focused on his own ruined rickshaw. This\u2026 this changed things. He stepped forward, chest puffed out, ignoring the throbbing in his temples. He needed to capitalize on this new wave of sympathy.",
