    "description": "Late afternoon on Shahrah-e-Faisal near Karachi Airport. Rush hour traffic gridlock. 40\u00c2\u00b0C heat, humid, dust everywhere. A green rickshaw driven by Saleem has collided with Ahmed Malik's white BMW \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the BMW has a visible dent on the left rear door, the rickshaw's front bumper is bent. Both drivers are out of their vehicles shouting. Horns blaring from backed-up traffic. A crowd of 15-20 people has already gathered, some recording on phones, others shouting opinions. A chai dhaba is right on the corner. Traffic police (known for asking bribes) are approaching. Nobody can move their vehicle until this is resolved. The crowd is getting restless \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they want the road cleared but they also want to see justice. In Karachi, the crowd decides more than the police.",

Constable Raza, looking distinctly uncomfortable in his starched uniform, was slowly making his way through the throng, his eyes scanning for the biggest potential payout. Just then, Uncle Jameel, propelled by sheer force of personality, bulldozed his way to the front, waving his hands like a traffic controller. He wore a faded green kurta and a permanent expression of knowing importance. A young boy scurried from his shop, balancing a tray laden with steaming glasses of chai. \"Aray, aray, what is this tamasha?!\" Uncle Jameel boomed, his voice cutting through the din. \"Everyone calm down! This is Shahrah-e-Faisal, not a jungle! Let Uncle Jameel handle this. I've seen more accidents than you've had hot dinners!\" He fixed Ahmed with a stern look. \"Sahib, you drive a fancy car, but even fancy cars make mistakes.

Ahmed Malik\u2019s offer of twenty thousand rupees felt\u2026insulting. It wasn\u2019t about the money anymore, not really. It was about principle. He glanced at the crowd, their faces a mixture of anger and sympathy. A young boy, no older than his eldest son, was mimicking his frantic gestures, earning a chuckle from a nearby man. Constable Raza, meanwhile, was subtly wiping sweat from his brow, his eyes darting around, clearly calculating the potential yield. Uncle Jameel was now directing traffic with theatrical sweeps of his arms, nearly getting clipped by a speeding motorcycle. The heat was oppressive, making Saleem\u2019s shirt stick to his back. He felt a tremor in his hands. He had to stand his ground. He had to. \n\nSaleem\u2019s voice cracked with emotion. \u201cTwenty thousand? Twenty thousand rupees for my livelihood? For my children\u2019s future? You think my rickshaw is worth just twenty thousand? This isn\u2019t Dubai, sahab! This is Karachi! Here, a man\u2019s dignity is worth more than your fancy BMW!\u201d He slammed his fist on the bent bumper, the metal groaning in protest. He then dramatically pulled out his empty wallet, turning it inside out for the crowd to see. \u201cLook! Empty! This is all I have! What will my children eat?\u201d",
