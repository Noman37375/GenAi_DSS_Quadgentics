# GenAI_DSS: Multi-Agent Narrative System

## 1. Introduction

A **Multi-Agent Narrative System** built for the **Hackfest x Datathon 2026** Generative AI module. The system uses **LangGraph** to orchestrate autonomous character agents that navigate a conflict-driven story defined by a "Story Seed."

Unlike traditional chatbots, these agents possess:
- **Individual Memory** — each character tracks what they've seen, heard, and done across turns.
- **Open-Ended Physical Actions** — agents perform any realistic action (not from a fixed menu) that changes the world state.
- **Deep Psychological Personas** — each character has a complete psychology, background, fears, strategies, and tactical evolution that guides their behavior across turns.
- **Structured Reasoning** — agents "think" through their goals before deciding whether to talk, act, or both.
- **LLM-Generated Story Twists** — the Director agent generates context-aware dramatic complications mid-story, unique every run.
- **Reviewer Agent** — a fifth agent checks each character turn for Karachi realism, logical consistency, and repetition; rejected turns get one retry with the reviewer's suggestion.
- **Real-Time Frontend** — React frontend with SSE streaming shows turns as they are generated.

## 2. Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- `uv` package manager
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
- Google API Key (Gemini Free Tier)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itbaans/GenAi_DSS.git
   cd GenAi_DSS
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd Hackthon_Frontend_IBA/frontend
   npm install
   cd ../..
   ```

4. **Environment Configuration**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```ini
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## 3. Usage

### Run Backend + Frontend Together
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts both the FastAPI backend (port 8000) and Vite frontend (port 5173) using `concurrently`.

### Run Backend Only (CLI mode)
```bash
uv run src/main.py
```

### Run Backend API Only
```bash
npm run dev:api
```

### Run Frontend Only
```bash
npm run dev:frontend
```

The system will:
1. Load the seed story and character configurations from `examples/rickshaw_accident/`.
2. Initialize 4 character agents + 1 Director agent + 1 Reviewer agent.
3. Run the narrative loop (15-25 turns) with open-ended actions, memory updates, an LLM-generated twist, and per-turn reviewer checks.
4. Generate `story_output.json` and `prompts_log.json`.
5. Stream each turn to the frontend in real-time via SSE.

## 4. System Architecture

### 4.1 Multi-Agent Design

The system follows a **Director-Agent** architecture orchestrated by a LangGraph `StateGraph`:

### 4.2 Agent Roles

| Agent | Role | Key Capability |
|---|---|---|
| **Director** | Orchestrator | Selects speakers, narrates scenes, generates twists, checks conclusion |
| **4 Character Agents** | Autonomous actors | Each has deep psychological persona, memory, reasoning, open-ended actions |
| **Reviewer** | Quality gate | Checks each turn for Karachi realism, language, logic, repetition |

## 5. Implemented Features

### 5.1 Character Memory System
Each character maintains an individual memory buffer (sliding window of 20 entries) that tracks:
- What they said and did in previous turns
- What other characters said and did (cross-character propagation)
- World events and story twists

Memory is stored in `StoryState.character_memories` as per-character lists and fed into each character's prompt.

### 5.2 Open-Ended Action System

**Design Philosophy**: Rather than restricting characters to a fixed menu of actions, the system allows **any realistic physical action**. Characters can grab keys, throw money, sit on the ground, block a path, make a phone call, push someone, wave down a passerby — anything a real person would do on a Karachi street.

The system uses **pattern-matching** to categorize actions for world-state tracking:

| Pattern | World State Effect | Example |
|---|---|---|
| money/pay/give | `money_exchanged`, `money_from`, `money_to` | `Give_Money → Ahmed Malik` |
| bribe/chai_pani | `bribe_offered`, `bribe_from`, `bribe_to` | `Offer_Bribe → Constable Raza` |
| challan/ticket/fine | `challan_written`, `challan_target` | `Write_Challan → Saleem` |
| key/confiscate/snatch | `keys_confiscated`, `keys_taken_from` | `Grab_Keys → Ahmed Malik` |
| record/video/film | `being_recorded`, `recorder` | `Record_Video` |
| block/stand_in_front | `vehicle_blocked`, `vehicle_blocked_by` | `Block_Path → Ahmed Malik` |
| push/shove/grab | `physical_confrontation_{actor}` | `Push_Away → Constable Raza` |
| call/phone/dial | `{actor}_made_call` | `Call_Lawyer` |
| sit/ground/collapse | `{actor}_on_ground` | `Sit_On_Road` |
| cry/wail/sob | `{actor}_crying` | `Break_Down_Crying` |
| *(any other)* | `action_{type}_{actor}` | `Tear_Document`, `Wave_Down_Taxi` |

Validation only checks: action is non-empty, target (if given) exists in character profiles, and actor is not targeting themselves.

### 5.3 Deep Psychological Personas

Each character has a complete psychological profile that drives behavior:

- **Saleem** (rickshaw driver): Street-smart poverty psychology. 95% Roman Urdu. Knows when to cry, when to get angry, when to play the victim. Tactical evolution from shock → anger → strategy → negotiation across turns.
- **Ahmed Malik** (businessman): Elite Karachiite psychology. English-Urdu code-switching. Oscillates between authority and fear of the crowd. Evolution from dismissive → frustrated → panicked → resigned.
- **Constable Raza** (traffic cop): Corrupt but cunning. 90% blunt street Urdu. Sees every situation as revenue. Plays both sides. Fear of cameras and DSP. Evolution from assessment → squeezing → negotiation → self-preservation.
- **Uncle Jameel** (shopkeeper elder): Lives for drama. 95% dramatic Urdu. Self-appointed mediator. Sides with the poor but presents as fair. Evolution from dramatic arrival → mediation → taking sides → brokering the deal.

Each persona includes explicit "WHAT YOU WOULD NEVER DO" rules and turn-range tactical evolution guidelines.

### 5.4 Reasoning Layer
Characters respond with structured JSON containing:
```json
{
    "reasoning": "Internal thought about strategy and what has changed",
    "decision": "talk | act | both",
    "dialogue": "Spoken words in character voice",
    "action": {
        "type": "Free-form label (e.g., Grab_Keys, Sit_On_Road, Throw_Money)",
        "target": "character name or null",
        "description": "Vivid description of the physical action"
    }
}
```
The `reasoning` field captures the agent's internal decision-making — forcing chain-of-thought before speaking or acting.

### 5.5 LLM-Generated Story Twists

At turn 9, the **Director agent generates a unique, context-aware twist** via a dedicated LLM call (`DIRECTOR_TWIST_PROMPT`). The twist:
- Is based on everything that has happened in the story so far
- Is realistic for a Karachi street scene
- Changes the dynamic for at least 2 characters
- Cannot be ignored — characters must react

Each run produces a **different twist** because it's generated from context, not selected from a fixed list. Examples from actual runs: "dhaba gas cylinder explosion nearby", "senior officer spotted approaching", "mechanic discovers hidden damage."

Twists update `world_state` and inject into ALL characters' memories, with 5-turn post-twist breathing room before conclusion is allowed.

### 5.6 Reviewer Agent

A fifth agent runs after each character turn, acting as a "born-and-raised Karachiite" quality gate. It checks:

1. **Language realism** — Saleem must not speak like a lawyer; Raza must sound blunt, not polite; Ahmed must code-switch naturally.
2. **Logical consistency** — Would a man earning 800/day refuse 20,000? Are damage amounts realistic (rickshaw bumper: 2,000-5,000, not 50,000)?
3. **Repetition** — Same emotional appeal or argument repeated? Same tactic with different words?
4. **Action logic** — Does the physical action fit the current moment?

If the reviewer rejects (major severity), the character gets **one retry** with the reviewer's suggestion appended to context. All reviewer calls are logged in `prompts_log.json`.

### 5.7 Director Intelligence
- **Story Phase System**: Setup (1-4) → Escalation (5-9) → Complication (10-15) → Resolution (16-22)
- **Anti-Consecutive**: Code-level enforcement prevents same character speaking twice in a row
- **Anti-Ping-Pong**: Detects when 2 characters dominate for 4+ turns and forces a third
- **Conclusion Resistance**: min_turns (15), min_actions (5), post-twist breathing room (5 turns), even-turn checks before turn 18, max_turns (25) hard cap

### 5.8 FastAPI Backend + React Frontend

**Backend** (`src/api.py`):
- `POST /api/run` — Run full narrative, return frontend-shaped payload
- `GET /api/story` — Return last story (200 with empty payload when none)
- `GET /api/run/stream` — SSE streaming: each reviewed turn sent as it's generated

**Frontend** (`Hackthon_Frontend_IBA/frontend/`):
- EventSource for real-time SSE streaming
- Turn-by-turn display with character avatars
- Auto-advance when new turn arrives during streaming
- Next button disabled while waiting for next turn
- Shows narration, dialogue, and action text per turn

## 6. Output Files

**`story_output.json`** — Final narrative trace:
- `title`, `seed_story` (metadata)
- `events[]` — chronological list with `type` (dialogue/narration/action), `speaker`, `content`, `turn`
- `conclusion` — why the story ended
- `metadata` — total turns, total actions, conclusion reason

**`prompts_log.json`** — Debug/audit log:
- `timestamp`, `agent`, `prompt`, `response` for every LLM call (Director, Character, Reviewer)
