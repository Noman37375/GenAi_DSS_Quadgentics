Rush hour traffic gridlock. 40\u00c2\u00b0C heat, humid, dust everywhere. A green rickshaw driven by Saleem has collided with Ahmed Malik's white BMW \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the BMW has a visible dent on the left rear door, the rickshaw's front bumper is bent. Both drivers are out of their vehicles shouting. Horns blaring from backed-up traffic. A crowd of 15-20 people has already gathered, some recording on phones, others shouting opinions. A chai dhaba is right on the corner. Traffic police (known for asking bribes) are approaching. Nobody can move their vehicle until this is resolved. The crowd is getting restless \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they want the road cleared but they also want to see justice. In Karachi, the crowd decides more than the police.\n\nWorld State (actions that have changed the situation):\nNothing notable yet.\n\nRecent Dialogue:\nNo dialogue yet. The story is just starting. Select the character most likely to speak first based on the Context.\n\nAvailable Characters (with descriptions):\n- Saleem: Poor rickshaw driver, sole earner for family of 5. Drives an old green rickshaw \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's his entire livelihood. Speaks street Urdu with some English words, uses 'bhai', 'yaar', 'sahab'. Panicked and desperate after his rickshaw's front bumper bent in a collision with a white BMW. Will get emotional \u00e2\u20ac\u201d can cry, sit on the ground, beat his chest, appeal to the crowd for support. Knows that in Karachi, the crowd usually sides with the poor man. Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move. (Goals: Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs, Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded, Get the crowd on his side, Get back to work to feed his family)\n- Ahmed Malik: Successful businessman, late for international flight to Dubai. Drives a white BMW which now has a dent on the left rear door. Speaks formal English-Urdu mix. Impatient, entitled, but increasingly nervous because the crowd is growing and hostile toward him. Knows that in Karachi, a rich man surrounded by an angry crowd is in a vulnerable position. His BMW is physically blocked by the rickshaw and the crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he CANNOT just drive away. His real fear is not the damage cost but being stuck here while his flight leaves. Will try to use money and authority to escape the situation quickly. (Goals: Escape this situation as fast as possible, Get to the airport before his flight leaves, Not appear weak in front of the crowd, Minimize the money he has to pay)\n- Constable Raza: 15-year traffic police veteran posted on Shahrah-e-Faisal. Underpaid, cynical, and corrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not stupid. Arrived at the scene of a rickshaw-BMW collision. Sees both parties as sources of income. Speaks blunt street Urdu \u00e2\u20ac\u201d does NOT use polite words like 'facilitation fee', just directly asks for money or threatens consequences. Will physically take keys or papers as leverage. Is nervous about people recording on phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201d doesn't want a viral video of him taking a bribe. Knows how to play both sides. May threaten to impound the rickshaw or write a challan to pressure both parties. (Goals: Extract maximum money from the situation, Clear the traffic jam before his senior notices, Avoid being recorded taking a bribe, Maintain control of the scene)\n- Uncle Jameel: Local shopkeeper whose shop is right on the corner where the accident happened. 60 years old, been on this street for 30 years. Witnessed the rickshaw hitting the white BMW. Extremely nosy, loves being involved in drama, gives unsolicited advice loudly. Speaks thick Urdu with dramatic flair. Physically inserts himself into situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone. (Goals: Be the one who resolves this situation, Protect Saleem as a fellow common man, Show off his connections and importance, Keep the drama going as long as it entertains him)\n\nActions taken so far: 0 (minimum 5 required before story can end)\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak or act next to advance the story naturally.\nConsider:\n1. Who would naturally respond to the last statement or action?\n2. What dramatic twist, physical action, or emotional reaction is needed?\n3. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n4. IMPORTANT: If the last 3-4 turns are between the same 2 characters going back and forth on the same topic, you MUST pick a different character to break the pattern.\n5. Use each character's personality and goals to decide when they would naturally jump in \u2014 a mediator should intervene when tension rises, an authority figure should assert control when things get chaotic.\n6. Consider the crowd \u2014 in Karachi, the crowd is always watching, reacting, pressuring. Your narration should reflect this.\n7.

Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move.

Who would naturally respond to the last statement or action?\n2. What dramatic twist, physical action, or emotional reaction is needed?\n3. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n4. IMPORTANT: If the last 3-4 turns are between the same 2 characters going back and forth on the same topic, you MUST pick a different character to break the pattern.\n5.

Consider the crowd \u2014 in Karachi, the crowd is always watching, reacting, pressuring. Your narration should reflect this.\n7. If fewer than 5 actions have been taken, encourage characters who might perform physical actions (blocking vehicles, grabbing keys, recording video, offering chai, etc.)\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration describing the scene \u2014 include crowd reactions, environmental details (heat, honking, dust), and physical movements\"\n}\n",

Drives an old green rickshaw \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's his entire livelihood. Speaks street Urdu with some English words, uses 'bhai', 'yaar', 'sahab'. Panicked and desperate after his rickshaw's front bumper bent in a collision with a white BMW. Will get emotional \u00e2\u20ac\u201d can cry, sit on the ground, beat his chest, appeal to the crowd for support. Knows that in Karachi, the crowd usually sides with the poor man. Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move. (Goals: Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs, Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded, Get the crowd on his side, Get back to work to feed his family)\n- Ahmed Malik: Successful businessman, late for international flight to Dubai. Drives a white BMW which now has a dent on the left rear door. Speaks formal English-Urdu mix. Impatient, entitled, but increasingly nervous because the crowd is growing and hostile toward him. Knows that in Karachi, a rich man surrounded by an angry crowd is in a vulnerable position. His BMW is physically blocked by the rickshaw and the crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he CANNOT just drive away. His real fear is not the damage cost but being stuck here while his flight leaves. Will try to use money and authority to escape the situation quickly. (Goals: Escape this situation as fast as possible, Get to the airport before his flight leaves, Not appear weak in front of the crowd, Minimize the money he has to pay)\n- Constable Raza: 15-year traffic police veteran posted on Shahrah-e-Faisal. Underpaid, cynical, and corrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not stupid. Arrived at the scene of a rickshaw-BMW collision. Sees both parties as sources of income. Speaks blunt street Urdu \u00e2\u20ac\u201d does NOT use polite words like 'facilitation fee', just directly asks for money or threatens consequences. Will physically take keys or papers as leverage. Is nervous about people recording on phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201d doesn't want a viral video of him taking a bribe. Knows how to play both sides. May threaten to impound the rickshaw or write a challan to pressure both parties. (Goals: Extract maximum money from the situation, Clear the traffic jam before his senior notices, Avoid being recorded taking a bribe, Maintain control of the scene)\n- Uncle Jameel: Local shopkeeper whose shop is right on the corner where the accident happened. 60 years old, been on this street for 30 years. Witnessed the rickshaw hitting the white BMW. Extremely nosy, loves being involved in drama, gives unsolicited advice loudly. Speaks thick Urdu with dramatic flair. Physically inserts himself into situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone. (Goals: Be the one who resolves this situation, Protect Saleem as a fellow common man, Show off his connections and importance, Keep the drama going as long as it entertains him)\n\nActions taken so far: 4 (minimum 5 required before story can end)\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak or act next to advance the story naturally.\nConsider:\n1. Who would naturally respond to the last statement or action?\n2. What dramatic twist, physical action, or emotional reaction is needed?\n3. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n4. IMPORTANT: If the last 3-4 turns are between the same 2 characters going back and forth on the same topic, you MUST pick a different character to break the pattern.\n5. Use each character's personality and goals to decide when they would naturally jump in \u2014 a mediator should intervene when tension rises, an authority figure should assert control when things get chaotic.\n6. Consider the crowd \u2014 in Karachi, the crowd is always watching, reacting, pressuring. Your narration should reflect this.\n7. If fewer than 5 actions have been taken, encourage characters who might perform physical actions (blocking vehicles, grabbing keys, recording video, offering chai, etc.)\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration describing the scene \u2014 include crowd reactions, environmental details (heat, honking, dust), and physical movements\"\n}\n",

Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move. (Goals: Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs, Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded, Get the crowd on his side, Get back to work to feed his family)\n- Ahmed Malik: Successful businessman, late for international flight to Dubai. Drives a white BMW which now has a dent on the left rear door. Speaks formal English-Urdu mix. Impatient, entitled, but increasingly nervous because the crowd is growing and hostile toward him. Knows that in Karachi, a rich man surrounded by an angry crowd is in a vulnerable position. His BMW is physically blocked by the rickshaw and the crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he CANNOT just drive away. His real fear is not the damage cost but being stuck here while his flight leaves. Will try to use money and authority to escape the situation quickly. (Goals: Escape this situation as fast as possible, Get to the airport before his flight leaves, Not appear weak in front of the crowd, Minimize the money he has to pay)\n- Constable Raza: 15-year traffic police veteran posted on Shahrah-e-Faisal. Underpaid, cynical, and corrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not stupid. Arrived at the scene of a rickshaw-BMW collision. Sees both parties as sources of income. Speaks blunt street Urdu \u00e2\u20ac\u201d does NOT use polite words like 'facilitation fee', just directly asks for money or threatens consequences. Will physically take keys or papers as leverage. Is nervous about people recording on phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201d doesn't want a viral video of him taking a bribe. Knows how to play both sides. May threaten to impound the rickshaw or write a challan to pressure both parties. (Goals: Extract maximum money from the situation, Clear the traffic jam before his senior notices, Avoid being recorded taking a bribe, Maintain control of the scene)\n- Uncle Jameel: Local shopkeeper whose shop is right on the corner where the accident happened. 60 years old, been on this street for 30 years.

Physically inserts himself into situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone.

Drives an old green rickshaw \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's his entire livelihood. Speaks street Urdu with some English words, uses 'bhai', 'yaar', 'sahab'. Panicked and desperate after his rickshaw's front bumper bent in a collision with a white BMW. Will get emotional \u00e2\u20ac\u201d can cry, sit on the ground, beat his chest, appeal to the crowd for support. Knows that in Karachi, the crowd usually sides with the poor man. Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move. (Goals: Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs, Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded, Get the crowd on his side, Get back to work to feed his family)\n- Ahmed Malik: Successful businessman, late for international flight to Dubai. Drives a white BMW which now has a dent on the left rear door. Speaks formal English-Urdu mix. Impatient, entitled, but increasingly nervous because the crowd is growing and hostile toward him. Knows that in Karachi, a rich man surrounded by an angry crowd is in a vulnerable position. His BMW is physically blocked by the rickshaw and the crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he CANNOT just drive away. His real fear is not the damage cost but being stuck here while his flight leaves. Will try to use money and authority to escape the situation quickly. (Goals: Escape this situation as fast as possible, Get to the airport before his flight leaves, Not appear weak in front of the crowd, Minimize the money he has to pay)\n- Constable Raza: 15-year traffic police veteran posted on Shahrah-e-Faisal. Underpaid, cynical, and corrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not stupid. Arrived at the scene of a rickshaw-BMW collision. Sees both parties as sources of income. Speaks blunt street Urdu \u00e2\u20ac\u201d does NOT use polite words like 'facilitation fee', just directly asks for money or threatens consequences. Will physically take keys or papers as leverage. Is nervous about people recording on phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201d doesn't want a viral video of him taking a bribe. Knows how to play both sides. May threaten to impound the rickshaw or write a challan to pressure both parties. (Goals: Extract maximum money from the situation, Clear the traffic jam before his senior notices, Avoid being recorded taking a bribe, Maintain control of the scene)\n- Uncle Jameel: Local shopkeeper whose shop is right on the corner where the accident happened. 60 years old, been on this street for 30 years. Witnessed the rickshaw hitting the white BMW. Extremely nosy, loves being involved in drama, gives unsolicited advice loudly. Speaks thick Urdu with dramatic flair. Physically inserts himself into situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone. (Goals: Be the one who resolves this situation, Protect Saleem as a fellow common man, Show off his connections and importance, Keep the drama going as long as it entertains him)\n\nActions taken so far: 7 (minimum 5 required before story can end)\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak or act next to advance the story naturally.\nConsider:\n1. Who would naturally respond to the last statement or action?\n2. What dramatic twist, physical action, or emotional reaction is needed?\n3. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n4. IMPORTANT: If the last 3-4 turns are between the same 2 characters going back and forth on the same topic, you MUST pick a different character to break the pattern.\n5. Use each character's personality and goals to decide when they would naturally jump in \u2014 a mediator should intervene when tension rises, an authority figure should assert control when things get chaotic.\n6. Consider the crowd \u2014 in Karachi, the crowd is always watching, reacting, pressuring. Your narration should reflect this.\n7. If fewer than 5 actions have been taken, encourage characters who might perform physical actions (blocking vehicles, grabbing keys, recording video, offering chai, etc.)\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration describing the scene \u2014 include crowd reactions, environmental details (heat, honking, dust), and physical movements\"\n}\n",

Saleem remains stubbornly seated on the ground, clutching his head. Ahmed Malik is pacing, checking his watch every few seconds, his face a mask of frustration. The crowd is a restless sea of faces, murmuring and pointing phones. Uncle Jameel is already accepting the chai from Asif, handing cups around with a flourish. Raza, sensing the crowd\u2019s growing impatience and the potential for a viral video, steps forward, deliberately loud and authoritative. He glances at the phones pointed his way, a flicker of annoyance crossing his face. He needs to control this *now*.\"\n}\n```",

Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move.\n\nInitial Event: Late afternoon on Shahrah-e-Faisal near Karachi Airport. Rush hour traffic gridlock. 40\u00c2\u00b0C heat, humid, dust everywhere. A green rickshaw driven by Saleem has collided with Ahmed Malik's white BMW \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the BMW has a visible dent on the left rear door, the rickshaw's front bumper is bent. Both drivers are out of their vehicles shouting. Horns blaring from backed-up traffic. A crowd of 15-20 people has already gathered, some recording on phones, others shouting opinions. A chai dhaba is right on the corner. Traffic police (known for asking bribes) are approaching. Nobody can move their vehicle until this is resolved. The crowd is getting restless \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they want the road cleared but they also want to see justice. In Karachi, the crowd decides more than the police.\n\nDirector Narration: Ahmed Malik\u2019s offer of double the repair cost hangs in the air, but the crowd is murmuring, unconvinced. They\u2019ve seen this before \u2013 rich people throwing money around to avoid consequences. The heat is oppressive, shimmering off the asphalt, and the constant honking of the traffic is a physical weight. Dust swirls with every gust of wind. Saleem, despite accepting the money from Ahmed Malik, remains sitting on the ground, head in his hands. He looks up, tears welling in his eyes, and addresses the crowd, his voice cracking with desperation. He clutches the money tightly, but it doesn't seem to offer any comfort. \"Bhaiyon! Yeh paise\u2026 yeh paise meri rickshaw nahi banayenge! Yeh meri izzat nahi banayenge! He broke my livelihood! He thinks money solves everything? Look at him! He's worried about his flight, not about my family!\" He gestures dramatically towards Ahmed Malik, then beats his chest in anguish.\n\nYour Goals:\n- Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs\n- Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded\n- Get the crowd on his side\n- Get back to work to feed his family\n\nYour Inventory: old Nokia phone, small cash (200 rupees), rickshaw keys, tattered driving license\n\nYour Memory (things you remember):\n- [ACTION] Saleem: Sit_On_Ground (I dramatically sit down on the hot asphalt, clutching my chest and looking up at the crowd with tears streaming down my face, making sure to block the BMW slightly with my body.)\n- Turn 5: I said: Aray bhaiyon! Dekho toh! This police wala is saying 'sab theek ho jayega'\u2026 theek kaise hoga? My rickshaw is broken, my family will be hungry tonight! \n- [ACTION] Saleem: Block_Vehicle \u2192 Ahmed Malik (I stand directly in front of Ahmed Malik's BMW, arms outstretched, preventing him from getting into the car. I make sure to look directly at the crowd while doing this, pleading for their support.)\n- Turn 6: I said: Aray! Sab dekho! Yeh police wala bhi uske saath hai! Dubai, Dubai! Kya Dubai hamare bachchon se zyada important hai? Iske paise se meri rickshaw theek\n- [ACTION] Uncle Jameel: Record_Video (I pull out my phone and start recording a video of the scene, panning across Saleem sitting on the ground, Ahmed Malik looking stressed, and Constable Raza looking flustered. I make sure to get the crowd in the background.)\n- Turn 7: Uncle Jameel said: Aray, dekho, dekho! Yeh toh pura drama ban gaya hai! Saleem beta, utho, utho! Mat karo aise. Lekin suno sab, police wala bhi toh apna bhai hai. Aur ye\n- [ACTION] Constable Raza: Offer_Bribe \u2192 Ahmed Malik (I subtly gesture towards my palm with a 'chai-pani' motion, looking at Ahmed Malik while speaking, trying to imply a bribe for a quick resolution.)\n- Turn 8: Constable Raza said: Aray, Uncle Jameel sahab! Camera band karo thora. Yeh sab record karne se kya hoga? Inko dekho, dono bhai log hain. Saleem bhai, aapki rickshaw toot g\n- [ACTION] Ahmed Malik: Give_Money \u2192 Saleem (I pull out a thick wad of Pakistani rupees from my wallet, visibly displaying it to Saleem and the crowd, indicating I'm prepared to pay a substantial amount.)\n- Turn 9: Ahmed Malik said: Dekhiye, dekhiye! Enough is enough! I'm offering Saleem bhai *double* the cost of the rickshaw repair, cash right now. Double! And Constable Raza saha\n\nActions taken so far in the story: 9\n(The story needs at least 5 actions before it can conclude. Consider performing actions to advance the plot, not just talking.)\n\nRecent Dialogue and Actions:\nSaleem: Aray yaar! Dekho toh zara! This sahab is trying to ruin a poor man! I have a family to feed! Five children! Look at this rickshaw, it's my everything! He drives a fancy car, I drive this\u2026 this is all I have! Kuch toh bolo, bhaiyon!\nUncle Jameel: Aray, arey, arey! Kya ho raha hai yahan? Sab thoda shant ho jao! Dekho, dekho\u2026 this is Karachi, not America! Ghareeb aadmi ko tang na karo! (Hey, hey, hey! What is happening here? Everyone calm down a bit! Look, look\u2026 this is Karachi, not America! Don't harass the poor man!) Saleem beta, tum bilkul theek keh rahe ho. Aur bhaiyon, dekho, yeh sahab\u2026 unki gaadi toh insured hai, woh theek kara lenge. Iske upar itna drama karne ki kya zaroorat hai? Inspector Farooq mera dost hai, main usse baat karta hoon. Chalo, chalo, sab chai piyo, phir baat karte hain.\nAhmed Malik: Dekhiye, dekhiye! I am not trying to cheat anyone. I have a flight, a business meeting in Dubai! This is costing me money by the minute. Saleem bhai, I offered to pay for the damage, right? Let's just get a mechanic to look at it, a quick estimate. I'll pay *cash*, right now. And Uncle Jameel is right, Inspector Farooq is a good man, he'll sort it out. But we need to let him do his job, and I need to get to the airport!\nConstable Raza: Aray, aaram se, aaram se! Dubai nahi gaya toh kya hoga? Aur Saleem bhai, aapki family ka khana toh chalega hi. Dekhiye, main hoon yahan. Sab theek ho jayega\u2026 thoda time lagay ga. Lekin sab kuch\u2026 *settle* ho jayega. Inspector Farooq sahab bhi apne kaam mein busy honge. Chalo, pehle mujhe dekhao, kiski galti hai. Aur woh bhi\u2026 *thoda help* ke saath.\nSaleem: Aray bhaiyon! Dekho toh! This police wala is saying 'sab theek ho jayega'\u2026 theek kaise hoga? My rickshaw is broken, my family will be hungry tonight! And this sahab\u2026 he thinks a little money can fix everything? My life is worth more than his Dubai meeting! Kuch toh karo, bhaiyon, meri madad karo!\nSaleem: Aray! Sab dekho! Yeh police wala bhi uske saath hai! Dubai, Dubai! Kya Dubai hamare bachchon se zyada important hai? Iske paise se meri rickshaw theek hogi? Kuch toh karo, bhaiyon! Isko bolo! Isko bolo, meri rickshaw theek karwao!\nUncle Jameel: Aray, dekho, dekho! Yeh toh pura drama ban gaya hai! Saleem beta, utho, utho! Mat karo aise. Lekin suno sab, police wala bhi toh apna bhai hai. Aur yeh sahab\u2026 unko bhi apni flight ka tension hai. Lekin insaaf toh hona chahiye! Inspector Farooq sahab se main khud baat karta hoon, unko sab batata hoon. Chalo, phir se chai! Asif! Aur tray le ao, sabke liye!\nConstable Raza: Aray, Uncle Jameel sahab! Camera band karo thora. Yeh sab record karne se kya hoga? Inko dekho, dono bhai log hain. Saleem bhai, aapki rickshaw toot gayi, dukhi toh honge hi. Aur Ahmed sahab, unko Dubai jana hai, kaam hai. Dekhiye, main kya kar sakta hoon\u2026 thoda *madad* chahiye, phir sab theek ho jayega. Ahmed sahab, aapki gaadi insured hai, woh toh chalega hi. Lekin paperwork\u2026 woh sab time lagta hai. Saleem bhai, aapki rickshaw ka bhi kuch toh kharcha banay ga.\nAhmed Malik: Dekhiye, dekhiye! Enough is enough! I'm offering Saleem bhai *double* the cost of the rickshaw repair, cash right now. Double! And Constable Raza sahab, I understand procedure, but my time is also valuable. I'm losing thousands of rupees every minute. I will personally ensure a generous 'chai-pani' for everyone involved\u2026 if we can resolve this *immediately*. Is this understood?
