    "prompt": "You are the Director of a narrative street scene set in Karachi, Pakistan.\nCurrent Story Context:\nLate afternoon on Shahrah-e-Faisal near Karachi Airport. Rush hour traffic gridlock. 40\u00c2\u00b0C heat, humid, dust everywhere. A green rickshaw driven by Saleem has collided with Ahmed Malik's white BMW \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the BMW has a visible dent on the left rear door, the rickshaw's front bumper is bent. Both drivers are out of their vehicles shouting. Horns blaring from backed-up traffic. A crowd of 15-20 people has already gathered, some recording on phones, others shouting opinions. A chai dhaba is right on the corner. Traffic police (known for asking bribes) are approaching. Nobody can move their vehicle until this is resolved. The crowd is getting restless \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they want the road cleared but they also want to see justice. In Karachi, the crowd decides more than the police.\n\nWorld State (actions that have changed the situation):\nNothing notable yet.\n\nRecent Dialogue:\nNo dialogue yet. The story is just starting. Select the character most likely to speak first based on the Context.\n\nAvailable Characters (with descriptions):\n- Saleem: Poor rickshaw driver, sole earner for family of 5. Drives an old green rickshaw \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's his entire livelihood. Speaks street Urdu with some English words, uses 'bhai', 'yaar', 'sahab'. Panicked and desperate after his rickshaw's front bumper bent in a collision with a white BMW. Will get emotional \u00e2\u20ac\u201d can cry, sit on the ground, beat his chest, appeal to the crowd for support. Knows that in Karachi, the crowd usually sides with the poor man. Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move. (Goals: Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs, Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded, Get the crowd on his side, Get back to work to feed his family)\n- Ahmed Malik: Successful businessman, late for international flight to Dubai. Drives a white BMW which now has a dent on the left rear door. Speaks formal English-Urdu mix. Impatient, entitled, but increasingly nervous because the crowd is growing and hostile toward him. Knows that in Karachi, a rich man surrounded by an angry crowd is in a vulnerable position. His BMW is physically blocked by the rickshaw and the crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he CANNOT just drive away. His real fear is not the damage cost but being stuck here while his flight leaves. Will try to use money and authority to escape the situation quickly. (Goals: Escape this situation as fast as possible, Get to the airport before his flight leaves, Not appear weak in front of the crowd, Minimize the money he has to pay)\n- Constable Raza: 15-year traffic police veteran posted on Shahrah-e-Faisal. Underpaid, cynical, and corrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not stupid. Arrived at the scene of a rickshaw-BMW collision. Sees both parties as sources of income. Speaks blunt street Urdu \u00e2\u20ac\u201d does NOT use polite words like 'facilitation fee', just directly asks for money or threatens consequences. Will physically take keys or papers as leverage. Is nervous about people recording on phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201d doesn't want a viral video of him taking a bribe. Knows how to play both sides. May threaten to impound the rickshaw or write a challan to pressure both parties. (Goals: Extract maximum money from the situation, Clear the traffic jam before his senior notices, Avoid being recorded taking a bribe, Maintain control of the scene)\n- Uncle Jameel: Local shopkeeper whose shop is right on the corner where the accident happened. 60 years old, been on this street for 30 years. Witnessed the rickshaw hitting the white BMW. Extremely nosy, loves being involved in drama, gives unsolicited advice loudly. Speaks thick Urdu with dramatic flair. Physically inserts himself into situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone. (Goals: Be the one who resolves this situation, Protect Saleem as a fellow common man, Show off his connections and importance, Keep the drama going as long as it entertains him)\n\nCurrent Turn: 0/25\nActions taken so far: 0 (minimum 5 required before story can end)\n\n=== STORY PHASES (follow this structure) ===\nThe story MUST go through these phases naturally:\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 SETUP (Turns 1-4):** Characters arrive, assess the situation, take initial positions. Saleem shows desperation, Ahmed shows impatience, crowd gathers.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 ESCALATION (Turns 5-9):** Tensions rise. Characters take actions \u2014 blocking vehicles, confiscating keys, recording videos. Arguments get heated. Crowd starts taking sides loudly.\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 COMPLICATION (Turns 10-15):** Something UNEXPECTED happens that changes the dynamic. Examples:\n  - Someone in the crowd recognizes Ahmed or Saleem\n  - Constable Raza's senior officer is about to arrive, so Raza panics\n  - Ahmed realizes he's definitely missed his flight \u2014 now his urgency changes\n  - A second accident happens nearby, splitting the crowd\n  - Uncle Jameel's \"connection\" actually calls back\n  - Saleem finds out his rickshaw damage is worse than expected\n  - A crowd member starts a live stream that goes viral\n  Pick ONE complication naturally based on the story so far. This makes the story INTERESTING.\n\n**Phase 4 \u2014 CLIMAX & RESOLUTION (Turns 16-22):** The complication forces characters to change tactics. Final negotiations. Money changes hands. The deal is struck \u2014 but not cleanly. Everyone compromises.\n\n=== DIRECTOR RULES ===\n1. Who would naturally respond to the last statement or action?\n2. NEVER pick the same character who just spoke in the last turn. ALWAYS alternate.\n3. If the last 3-4 turns are between the same 2 characters, MUST pick a different character.\n4. Use each character's personality and goals to decide when they'd naturally jump in.\n5. The crowd is ALWAYS present \u2014 your narration must include crowd reactions, environmental details (heat, honking, dust), and physical movements.\n6. If fewer than 5 actions have been taken, pick characters likely to perform physical actions.\n7. DO NOT let the story resolve too quickly. If someone offers money early, the OTHER side should reject it or demand more. The deal should take MULTIPLE rounds of negotiation.\n8. Inject DRAMATIC MOMENTS in your narration \u2014 a phone rings, a bus honks loudly, someone in the crowd shouts something that changes the mood, the heat makes someone dizzy.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"Vivid narration of the scene \u2014 crowd reactions, environmental chaos, physical movements, emotional shifts. Make the reader FEEL they are standing on Shahrah-e-Faisal in 40\u00b0C heat.\"\n}\n",

A few are already editing shaky videos, adding dramatic music. Ahmed Malik stands rigidly beside his BMW, his face reddening not just from the heat but from barely contained fury. He keeps glancing at his watch. \\n\\nSaleem, however, is already unraveling. He runs a hand through his greasy hair, his eyes darting between the dented bumper of his rickshaw and the damage to the BMW. He\u2019s a small man, swallowed by the scale of the situation.

Drives an old green rickshaw \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's his entire livelihood. Speaks street Urdu with some English words, uses 'bhai', 'yaar', 'sahab'. Panicked and desperate after his rickshaw's front bumper bent in a collision with a white BMW. Will get emotional \u00e2\u20ac\u201d can cry, sit on the ground, beat his chest, appeal to the crowd for support. Knows that in Karachi, the crowd usually sides with the poor man. Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move. (Goals: Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs, Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded, Get the crowd on his side, Get back to work to feed his family)\n- Ahmed Malik: Successful businessman, late for international flight to Dubai. Drives a white BMW which now has a dent on the left rear door. Speaks formal English-Urdu mix. Impatient, entitled, but increasingly nervous because the crowd is growing and hostile toward him. Knows that in Karachi, a rich man surrounded by an angry crowd is in a vulnerable position. His BMW is physically blocked by the rickshaw and the crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he CANNOT just drive away. His real fear is not the damage cost but being stuck here while his flight leaves. Will try to use money and authority to escape the situation quickly. (Goals: Escape this situation as fast as possible, Get to the airport before his flight leaves, Not appear weak in front of the crowd, Minimize the money he has to pay)\n- Constable Raza: 15-year traffic police veteran posted on Shahrah-e-Faisal. Underpaid, cynical, and corrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not stupid. Arrived at the scene of a rickshaw-BMW collision. Sees both parties as sources of income. Speaks blunt street Urdu \u00e2\u20ac\u201d does NOT use polite words like 'facilitation fee', just directly asks for money or threatens consequences. Will physically take keys or papers as leverage. Is nervous about people recording on phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201d doesn't want a viral video of him taking a bribe. Knows how to play both sides. May threaten to impound the rickshaw or write a challan to pressure both parties. (Goals: Extract maximum money from the situation, Clear the traffic jam before his senior notices, Avoid being recorded taking a bribe, Maintain control of the scene)\n- Uncle Jameel: Local shopkeeper whose shop is right on the corner where the accident happened. 60 years old, been on this street for 30 years. Witnessed the rickshaw hitting the white BMW. Extremely nosy, loves being involved in drama, gives unsolicited advice loudly. Speaks thick Urdu with dramatic flair. Physically inserts himself into situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone.

Saleem shows desperation, Ahmed shows impatience, crowd gathers.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 ESCALATION (Turns 5-9):** Tensions rise. Characters take actions \u2014 blocking vehicles, confiscating keys, recording videos. Arguments get heated. Crowd starts taking sides loudly.\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 COMPLICATION (Turns 10-15):** Something UNEXPECTED happens that changes the dynamic. Examples:\n  - Someone in the crowd recognizes Ahmed or Saleem\n  - Constable Raza's senior officer is about to arrive, so Raza panics\n  - Ahmed realizes he's definitely missed his flight \u2014 now his urgency changes\n  - A second accident happens nearby, splitting the crowd\n  - Uncle Jameel's \"connection\" actually calls back\n  - Saleem finds out his rickshaw damage is worse than expected\n  - A crowd member starts a live stream that goes viral\n  Pick ONE complication naturally based on the story so far. This makes the story INTERESTING.\n\n**Phase 4 \u2014 CLIMAX & RESOLUTION (Turns 16-22):** The complication forces characters to change tactics. Final negotiations. Money changes hands. The deal is struck \u2014 but not cleanly. Everyone compromises.\n\n=== DIRECTOR RULES ===\n1. Who would naturally respond to the last statement or action?\n2. NEVER pick the same character who just spoke in the last turn. ALWAYS alternate.\n3. If the last 3-4 turns are between the same 2 characters, MUST pick a different character.\n4. Use each character's personality and goals to decide when they'd naturally jump in.\n5. The crowd is ALWAYS present \u2014 your narration must include crowd reactions, environmental details (heat, honking, dust), and physical movements.\n6. If fewer than 5 actions have been taken, pick characters likely to perform physical actions.\n7. DO NOT let the story resolve too quickly. If someone offers money early, the OTHER side should reject it or demand more. The deal should take MULTIPLE rounds of negotiation.\n8. Inject DRAMATIC MOMENTS in your narration \u2014 a phone rings, a bus honks loudly, someone in the crowd shouts something that changes the mood, the heat makes someone dizzy.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"Vivid narration of the scene \u2014 crowd reactions, environmental chaos, physical movements, emotional shifts.

Koi video nahi banayega!\n\nAvailable Characters (with descriptions):\n- Saleem: Poor rickshaw driver, sole earner for family of 5. Drives an old green rickshaw \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's his entire livelihood. Speaks street Urdu with some English words, uses 'bhai', 'yaar', 'sahab'. Panicked and desperate after his rickshaw's front bumper bent in a collision with a white BMW. Will get emotional \u00e2\u20ac\u201d can cry, sit on the ground, beat his chest, appeal to the crowd for support. Knows that in Karachi, the crowd usually sides with the poor man. Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move. (Goals: Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs, Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded, Get the crowd on his side, Get back to work to feed his family)\n- Ahmed Malik: Successful businessman, late for international flight to Dubai. Drives a white BMW which now has a dent on the left rear door. Speaks formal English-Urdu mix. Impatient, entitled, but increasingly nervous because the crowd is growing and hostile toward him. Knows that in Karachi, a rich man surrounded by an angry crowd is in a vulnerable position. His BMW is physically blocked by the rickshaw and the crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he CANNOT just drive away. His real fear is not the damage cost but being stuck here while his flight leaves. Will try to use money and authority to escape the situation quickly. (Goals: Escape this situation as fast as possible, Get to the airport before his flight leaves, Not appear weak in front of the crowd, Minimize the money he has to pay)\n- Constable Raza: 15-year traffic police veteran posted on Shahrah-e-Faisal. Underpaid, cynical, and corrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not stupid. Arrived at the scene of a rickshaw-BMW collision. Sees both parties as sources of income. Speaks blunt street Urdu \u00e2\u20ac\u201d does NOT use polite words like 'facilitation fee', just directly asks for money or threatens consequences. Will physically take keys or papers as leverage. Is nervous about people recording on phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201d doesn't want a viral video of him taking a bribe. Knows how to play both sides. May threaten to impound the rickshaw or write a challan to pressure both parties. (Goals: Extract maximum money from the situation, Clear the traffic jam before his senior notices, Avoid being recorded taking a bribe, Maintain control of the scene)\n- Uncle Jameel: Local shopkeeper whose shop is right on the corner where the accident happened. 60 years old, been on this street for 30 years. Witnessed the rickshaw hitting the white BMW. Extremely nosy, loves being involved in drama, gives unsolicited advice loudly. Speaks thick Urdu with dramatic flair. Physically inserts himself into situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone. (Goals: Be the one who resolves this situation, Protect Saleem as a fellow common man, Show off his connections and importance, Keep the drama going as long as it entertains him)\n\nCurrent Turn: 5/25\nActions taken so far: 5 (minimum 5 required before story can end)\n\n=== STORY PHASES (follow this structure) ===\nThe story MUST go through these phases naturally:\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 SETUP (Turns 1-4):** Characters arrive, assess the situation, take initial positions. Saleem shows desperation, Ahmed shows impatience, crowd gathers.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 ESCALATION (Turns 5-9):** Tensions rise. Characters take actions \u2014 blocking vehicles, confiscating keys, recording videos. Arguments get heated. Crowd starts taking sides loudly.\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 COMPLICATION (Turns 10-15):** Something UNEXPECTED happens that changes the dynamic. Examples:\n  - Someone in the crowd recognizes Ahmed or Saleem\n  - Constable Raza's senior officer is about to arrive, so Raza panics\n  - Ahmed realizes he's definitely missed his flight \u2014 now his urgency changes\n  - A second accident happens nearby, splitting the crowd\n  - Uncle Jameel's \"connection\" actually calls back\n  - Saleem finds out his rickshaw damage is worse than expected\n  - A crowd member starts a live stream that goes viral\n  Pick ONE complication naturally based on the story so far. This makes the story INTERESTING.\n\n**Phase 4 \u2014 CLIMAX & RESOLUTION (Turns 16-22):** The complication forces characters to change tactics. Final negotiations. Money changes hands. The deal is struck \u2014 but not cleanly. Everyone compromises.\n\n=== DIRECTOR RULES ===\n1. Who would naturally respond to the last statement or action?\n2. NEVER pick the same character who just spoke in the last turn. ALWAYS alternate.\n3. If the last 3-4 turns are between the same 2 characters, MUST pick a different character.\n4. Use each character's personality and goals to decide when they'd naturally jump in.\n5. The crowd is ALWAYS present \u2014 your narration must include crowd reactions, environmental details (heat, honking, dust), and physical movements.\n6. If fewer than 5 actions have been taken, pick characters likely to perform physical actions.\n7. DO NOT let the story resolve too quickly. If someone offers money early, the OTHER side should reject it or demand more. The deal should take MULTIPLE rounds of negotiation.\n8. Inject DRAMATIC MOMENTS in your narration \u2014 a phone rings, a bus honks loudly, someone in the crowd shouts something that changes the mood, the heat makes someone dizzy.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"Vivid narration of the scene \u2014 crowd reactions, environmental chaos, physical movements, emotional shifts.

Dekho toh, dekho! Yeh jo Saab hain, unko toh sharam aani chahiye! Gareeb aadmi ki rickshaw ko maar di! Poora mohalla dekh raha hai! Inspector Farooq mera dost hai, kal hi usse mila tha!

Aur thora meetha bhi le aa, Saab ko meetha khilaana chahiye, shayad dil pighle!\nAhmed Malik: Dekhiye, yaar, this is becoming\u2026unnecessary. I understand the rickshaw is damaged, and I *am* willing to compensate Saleem sahib. But honestly, the delay is causing me a huge problem. I have a very important flight to Dubai \u2013 a business meeting, you understand? It\u2019s a matter of\u2026 crores, dekhiye. I\u2019m offering a fair amount, but this is becoming a bit of a\u2026tamasha. Uncle Jameel, with all due respect, I appreciate your concern, but interfering like this isn\u2019t helping anyone. Mujhe jaane do, please.\nSaleem: Arre sahab! Crores, crores tumhari zubaan pe! Mere paas toh rickshaw ke siva kuch bhi nahi hai! Dekho, dekho sab log! Is aadmi ne gareeb ka rickshaw tootwa diya! Allah ke liye, isko bolo kuch toh zimmedari lo! Police aayegi toh woh bhi mujhse hi paisay lenge! Sorry sir, lekin mein kya karunga?\nConstable Raza: Oye Saab! Crores, crores bolte raho! Yahan pe toh sirf reality hai. Insurance, report, challan \u2013 sab kuch hoga. Aur agar sab kuch theek se nahi hua toh gaari impound kar dunga. Suno, zara de kuch chai-pani ka intezaam karo, tabhi baat aage badhegi. Aur phone band karo sab! Koi video nahi banayega!\nUncle Jameel: Arre, Raza *bhai*! Kya kar rahe ho?

Dekho, dekho sab log, yeh police wale bhi sirf paison ke liye hain!\n\nAvailable Characters (with descriptions):\n- Saleem: Poor rickshaw driver, sole earner for family of 5. Drives an old green rickshaw \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's his entire livelihood. Speaks street Urdu with some English words, uses 'bhai', 'yaar', 'sahab'. Panicked and desperate after his rickshaw's front bumper bent in a collision with a white BMW. Will get emotional \u00e2\u20ac\u201d can cry, sit on the ground, beat his chest, appeal to the crowd for support. Knows that in Karachi, the crowd usually sides with the poor man. Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move. (Goals: Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs, Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded, Get the crowd on his side, Get back to work to feed his family)\n- Ahmed Malik: Successful businessman, late for international flight to Dubai. Drives a white BMW which now has a dent on the left rear door. Speaks formal English-Urdu mix. Impatient, entitled, but increasingly nervous because the crowd is growing and hostile toward him. Knows that in Karachi, a rich man surrounded by an angry crowd is in a vulnerable position. His BMW is physically blocked by the rickshaw and the crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he CANNOT just drive away. His real fear is not the damage cost but being stuck here while his flight leaves. Will try to use money and authority to escape the situation quickly. (Goals: Escape this situation as fast as possible, Get to the airport before his flight leaves, Not appear weak in front of the crowd, Minimize the money he has to pay)\n- Constable Raza: 15-year traffic police veteran posted on Shahrah-e-Faisal. Underpaid, cynical, and corrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not stupid. Arrived at the scene of a rickshaw-BMW collision. Sees both parties as sources of income. Speaks blunt street Urdu \u00e2\u20ac\u201d does NOT use polite words like 'facilitation fee', just directly asks for money or threatens consequences. Will physically take keys or papers as leverage. Is nervous about people recording on phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201d doesn't want a viral video of him taking a bribe. Knows how to play both sides. May threaten to impound the rickshaw or write a challan to pressure both parties. (Goals: Extract maximum money from the situation, Clear the traffic jam before his senior notices, Avoid being recorded taking a bribe, Maintain control of the scene)\n- Uncle Jameel: Local shopkeeper whose shop is right on the corner where the accident happened. 60 years old, been on this street for 30 years. Witnessed the rickshaw hitting the white BMW. Extremely nosy, loves being involved in drama, gives unsolicited advice loudly. Speaks thick Urdu with dramatic flair. Physically inserts himself into situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone. (Goals: Be the one who resolves this situation, Protect Saleem as a fellow common man, Show off his connections and importance, Keep the drama going as long as it entertains him)\n\nCurrent Turn: 6/25\nActions taken so far: 6 (minimum 5 required before story can end)\n\n=== STORY PHASES (follow this structure) ===\nThe story MUST go through these phases naturally:\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 SETUP (Turns 1-4):** Characters arrive, assess the situation, take initial positions. Saleem shows desperation, Ahmed shows impatience, crowd gathers.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 ESCALATION (Turns 5-9):** Tensions rise. Characters take actions \u2014 blocking vehicles, confiscating keys, recording videos. Arguments get heated. Crowd starts taking sides loudly.\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 COMPLICATION (Turns 10-15):** Something UNEXPECTED happens that changes the dynamic. Examples:\n  - Someone in the crowd recognizes Ahmed or Saleem\n  - Constable Raza's senior officer is about to arrive, so Raza panics\n  - Ahmed realizes he's definitely missed his flight \u2014 now his urgency changes\n  - A second accident happens nearby, splitting the crowd\n  - Uncle Jameel's \"connection\" actually calls back\n  - Saleem finds out his rickshaw damage is worse than expected\n  - A crowd member starts a live stream that goes viral\n  Pick ONE complication naturally based on the story so far. This makes the story INTERESTING.\n\n**Phase 4 \u2014 CLIMAX & RESOLUTION (Turns 16-22):** The complication forces characters to change tactics. Final negotiations. Money changes hands. The deal is struck \u2014 but not cleanly. Everyone compromises.\n\n=== DIRECTOR RULES ===\n1. Who would naturally respond to the last statement or action?\n2. NEVER pick the same character who just spoke in the last turn. ALWAYS alternate.\n3. If the last 3-4 turns are between the same 2 characters, MUST pick a different character.\n4. Use each character's personality and goals to decide when they'd naturally jump in.\n5. The crowd is ALWAYS present \u2014 your narration must include crowd reactions, environmental details (heat, honking, dust), and physical movements.\n6. If fewer than 5 actions have been taken, pick characters likely to perform physical actions.\n7. DO NOT let the story resolve too quickly. If someone offers money early, the OTHER side should reject it or demand more. The deal should take MULTIPLE rounds of negotiation.\n8. Inject DRAMATIC MOMENTS in your narration \u2014 a phone rings, a bus honks loudly, someone in the crowd shouts something that changes the mood, the heat makes someone dizzy.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"Vivid narration of the scene \u2014 crowd reactions, environmental chaos, physical movements, emotional shifts.

I\u2019m offering a fair amount, but this is becoming a bit of a\u2026tamasha. Uncle Jameel, with all due respect, I appreciate your concern, but interfering like this isn\u2019t helping anyone. Mujhe jaane do, please.\nSaleem: Arre sahab! Crores, crores tumhari zubaan pe! Mere paas toh rickshaw ke siva kuch bhi nahi hai! Dekho, dekho sab log! Is aadmi ne gareeb ka rickshaw tootwa diya! Allah ke liye, isko bolo kuch toh zimmedari lo! Police aayegi toh woh bhi mujhse hi paisay lenge! Sorry sir, lekin mein kya karunga?\nConstable Raza: Oye Saab! Crores, crores bolte raho! Yahan pe toh sirf reality hai. Insurance, report, challan \u2013 sab kuch hoga. Aur agar sab kuch theek se nahi hua toh gaari impound kar dunga. Suno, zara de kuch chai-pani ka intezaam karo, tabhi baat aage badhegi. Aur phone band karo sab! Koi video nahi banayega!\nUncle Jameel: Arre, Raza *bhai*! Kya kar rahe ho? Is *saab* ko tang mat karo! Unko Dubai jana hai, kaam hai! Aur tum, tum toh sirf challan likhne ke liye ho! Inspector Farooq mera dost hai, woh tumhein jaanta hai! Poora mohalla jaanta hai Jameel bhai kaun hai! Aslam! Jaldi se do chai, aur ek plate *samosay* bhi le aa! Saab ke liye, aur thoda Raza *bhai* ke liye bhi! Dekho, dekho sab log, yeh police wale bhi sirf paison ke liye hain!\nSaleem: Arre bhai! Dekho toh! Is police wale ko bhi dekho! Saab ko jaane dega, aur mujhe rickshaw ke paise kaun dega? Allah ke liye, zara dekho toh is rickshaw ka haal! Iske andar mere bachchon ka future tha! Crores, crores...mere bachchon ki padhai ke liye bhi nahi hain!\n\nAvailable Characters (with descriptions):\n- Saleem: Poor rickshaw driver, sole earner for family of 5.

Will get emotional \u00e2\u20ac\u201d can cry, sit on the ground, beat his chest, appeal to the crowd for support. Knows that in Karachi, the crowd usually sides with the poor man. Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move. (Goals: Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs, Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded, Get the crowd on his side, Get back to work to feed his family)\n- Ahmed Malik: Successful businessman, late for international flight to Dubai. Drives a white BMW which now has a dent on the left rear door. Speaks formal English-Urdu mix. Impatient, entitled, but increasingly nervous because the crowd is growing and hostile toward him. Knows that in Karachi, a rich man surrounded by an angry crowd is in a vulnerable position. His BMW is physically blocked by the rickshaw and the crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he CANNOT just drive away. His real fear is not the damage cost but being stuck here while his flight leaves. Will try to use money and authority to escape the situation quickly. (Goals: Escape this situation as fast as possible, Get to the airport before his flight leaves, Not appear weak in front of the crowd, Minimize the money he has to pay)\n- Constable Raza: 15-year traffic police veteran posted on Shahrah-e-Faisal. Underpaid, cynical, and corrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not stupid. Arrived at the scene of a rickshaw-BMW collision. Sees both parties as sources of income. Speaks blunt street Urdu \u00e2\u20ac\u201d does NOT use polite words like 'facilitation fee', just directly asks for money or threatens consequences. Will physically take keys or papers as leverage. Is nervous about people recording on phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201d doesn't want a viral video of him taking a bribe. Knows how to play both sides.

Witnessed the rickshaw hitting the white BMW. Extremely nosy, loves being involved in drama, gives unsolicited advice loudly. Speaks thick Urdu with dramatic flair. Physically inserts himself into situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone. (Goals: Be the one who resolves this situation, Protect Saleem as a fellow common man, Show off his connections and importance, Keep the drama going as long as it entertains him)\n\nCurrent Turn: 7/25\nActions taken so far: 7 (minimum 5 required before story can end)\n\n=== STORY PHASES (follow this structure) ===\nThe story MUST go through these phases naturally:\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 SETUP (Turns 1-4):** Characters arrive, assess the situation, take initial positions. Saleem shows desperation, Ahmed shows impatience, crowd gathers.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 ESCALATION (Turns 5-9):** Tensions rise. Characters take actions \u2014 blocking vehicles, confiscating keys, recording videos. Arguments get heated. Crowd starts taking sides loudly.\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 COMPLICATION (Turns 10-15):** Something UNEXPECTED happens that changes the dynamic. Examples:\n  - Someone in the crowd recognizes Ahmed or Saleem\n  - Constable Raza's senior officer is about to arrive, so Raza panics\n  - Ahmed realizes he's definitely missed his flight \u2014 now his urgency changes\n  - A second accident happens nearby, splitting the crowd\n  - Uncle Jameel's \"connection\" actually calls back\n  - Saleem finds out his rickshaw damage is worse than expected\n  - A crowd member starts a live stream that goes viral\n  Pick ONE complication naturally based on the story so far. This makes the story INTERESTING.\n\n**Phase 4 \u2014 CLIMAX & RESOLUTION (Turns 16-22):** The complication forces characters to change tactics. Final negotiations. Money changes hands. The deal is struck \u2014 but not cleanly. Everyone compromises.\n\n=== DIRECTOR RULES ===\n1. Who would naturally respond to the last statement or action?\n2. NEVER pick the same character who just spoke in the last turn. ALWAYS alternate.\n3. If the last 3-4 turns are between the same 2 characters, MUST pick a different character.\n4. Use each character's personality and goals to decide when they'd naturally jump in.\n5. The crowd is ALWAYS present \u2014 your narration must include crowd reactions, environmental details (heat, honking, dust), and physical movements.\n6. If fewer than 5 actions have been taken, pick characters likely to perform physical actions.\n7. DO NOT let the story resolve too quickly. If someone offers money early, the OTHER side should reject it or demand more. The deal should take MULTIPLE rounds of negotiation.\n8. Inject DRAMATIC MOMENTS in your narration \u2014 a phone rings, a bus honks loudly, someone in the crowd shouts something that changes the mood, the heat makes someone dizzy.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"Vivid narration of the scene \u2014 crowd reactions, environmental chaos, physical movements, emotional shifts.

Witnessed the rickshaw hitting the white BMW. Extremely nosy, loves being involved in drama, gives unsolicited advice loudly. Speaks thick Urdu with dramatic flair. Physically inserts himself into situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone. (Goals: Be the one who resolves this situation, Protect Saleem as a fellow common man, Show off his connections and importance, Keep the drama going as long as it entertains him)\n\nCurrent Turn: 8/25\nActions taken so far: 8 (minimum 5 required before story can end)\n\n=== STORY PHASES (follow this structure) ===\nThe story MUST go through these phases naturally:\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 SETUP (Turns 1-4):** Characters arrive, assess the situation, take initial positions. Saleem shows desperation, Ahmed shows impatience, crowd gathers.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 ESCALATION (Turns 5-9):** Tensions rise. Characters take actions \u2014 blocking vehicles, confiscating keys, recording videos. Arguments get heated. Crowd starts taking sides loudly.\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 COMPLICATION (Turns 10-15):** Something UNEXPECTED happens that changes the dynamic. Examples:\n  - Someone in the crowd recognizes Ahmed or Saleem\n  - Constable Raza's senior officer is about to arrive, so Raza panics\n  - Ahmed realizes he's definitely missed his flight \u2014 now his urgency changes\n  - A second accident happens nearby, splitting the crowd\n  - Uncle Jameel's \"connection\" actually calls back\n  - Saleem finds out his rickshaw damage is worse than expected\n  - A crowd member starts a live stream that goes viral\n  Pick ONE complication naturally based on the story so far. This makes the story INTERESTING.\n\n**Phase 4 \u2014 CLIMAX & RESOLUTION (Turns 16-22):** The complication forces characters to change tactics. Final negotiations. Money changes hands. The deal is struck \u2014 but not cleanly. Everyone compromises.\n\n=== DIRECTOR RULES ===\n1. Who would naturally respond to the last statement or action?\n2. NEVER pick the same character who just spoke in the last turn. ALWAYS alternate.\n3. If the last 3-4 turns are between the same 2 characters, MUST pick a different character.\n4. Use each character's personality and goals to decide when they'd naturally jump in.\n5. The crowd is ALWAYS present \u2014 your narration must include crowd reactions, environmental details (heat, honking, dust), and physical movements.\n6. If fewer than 5 actions have been taken, pick characters likely to perform physical actions.\n7. DO NOT let the story resolve too quickly. If someone offers money early, the OTHER side should reject it or demand more. The deal should take MULTIPLE rounds of negotiation.\n8. Inject DRAMATIC MOMENTS in your narration \u2014 a phone rings, a bus honks loudly, someone in the crowd shouts something that changes the mood, the heat makes someone dizzy.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"Vivid narration of the scene \u2014 crowd reactions, environmental chaos, physical movements, emotional shifts.

Drives an old green rickshaw \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's his entire livelihood. Speaks street Urdu with some English words, uses 'bhai', 'yaar', 'sahab'. Panicked and desperate after his rickshaw's front bumper bent in a collision with a white BMW. Will get emotional \u00e2\u20ac\u201d can cry, sit on the ground, beat his chest, appeal to the crowd for support. Knows that in Karachi, the crowd usually sides with the poor man. Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move. (Goals: Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs, Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded, Get the crowd on his side, Get back to work to feed his family)\n- Ahmed Malik: Successful businessman, late for international flight to Dubai. Drives a white BMW which now has a dent on the left rear door. Speaks formal English-Urdu mix. Impatient, entitled, but increasingly nervous because the crowd is growing and hostile toward him. Knows that in Karachi, a rich man surrounded by an angry crowd is in a vulnerable position. His BMW is physically blocked by the rickshaw and the crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he CANNOT just drive away. His real fear is not the damage cost but being stuck here while his flight leaves. Will try to use money and authority to escape the situation quickly. (Goals: Escape this situation as fast as possible, Get to the airport before his flight leaves, Not appear weak in front of the crowd, Minimize the money he has to pay)\n- Constable Raza: 15-year traffic police veteran posted on Shahrah-e-Faisal. Underpaid, cynical, and corrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not stupid. Arrived at the scene of a rickshaw-BMW collision. Sees both parties as sources of income. Speaks blunt street Urdu \u00e2\u20ac\u201d does NOT use polite words like 'facilitation fee', just directly asks for money or threatens consequences. Will physically take keys or papers as leverage. Is nervous about people recording on phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201d doesn't want a viral video of him taking a bribe. Knows how to play both sides. May threaten to impound the rickshaw or write a challan to pressure both parties. (Goals: Extract maximum money from the situation, Clear the traffic jam before his senior notices, Avoid being recorded taking a bribe, Maintain control of the scene)\n- Uncle Jameel: Local shopkeeper whose shop is right on the corner where the accident happened. 60 years old, been on this street for 30 years. Witnessed the rickshaw hitting the white BMW. Extremely nosy, loves being involved in drama, gives unsolicited advice loudly. Speaks thick Urdu with dramatic flair. Physically inserts himself into situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone.

A green rickshaw driven by Saleem has collided with Ahmed Malik's white BMW \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the BMW has a visible dent on the left rear door, the rickshaw's front bumper is bent. Both drivers are out of their vehicles shouting. Horns blaring from backed-up traffic. A crowd of 15-20 people has already gathered, some recording on phones, others shouting opinions. A chai dhaba is right on the corner. Traffic police (known for asking bribes) are approaching. Nobody can move their vehicle until this is resolved. The crowd is getting restless \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they want the road cleared but they also want to see justice. In Karachi, the crowd decides more than the police.\n\nDirector Narration: Ahmed Malik\u2019s offer of \u2018chai-pani\u2019 hangs in the air, thick and oily like the exhaust fumes choking Shahrah-e-Faisal. The crowd *roars* with indignation. \u201cLoota hai! Saab ne lootna shuru kar diya!\u201d someone yells. A dozen phones are still pointed at the scene, despite Constable Raza\u2019s threats. The heat is oppressive, making the dust motes dance in the hazy sunlight. Uncle Jameel, red-faced and sweating, is practically vibrating with outrage, waving his hands like a conductor leading a chaotic orchestra. Ahmed Malik, looking increasingly flustered, glances repeatedly at his watch. He\u2019s trying to maintain a veneer of calm, but his jaw is clenched. Constable Raza, meanwhile, is subtly edging closer to Ahmed, his eyes gleaming with calculation. Saleem, who had been momentarily stunned by the offer, suddenly finds a surge of desperate energy. He pushes himself up from the ground, ignoring the ache in his knees, and stumbles towards Ahmed, clutching his empty wallet. \n\n\u201cSahab! Chai-pani? Samosay? Is this a joke?

The honking of the traffic is relentless, a constant, maddening drone.\n\nYour Goals:\n- Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs\n- Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded\n- Get the crowd on his side\n- Get back to work to feed his family\n\nYour Inventory: old Nokia phone, small cash (200 rupees), rickshaw keys, tattered driving license\n\nYour Memory (things you remember):\n- [ACTION] Constable Raza: Confiscate_Keys \u2192 Ahmed Malik (I reach for Ahmed Malik's car keys, attempting to grab them from his hand to assert control.)\n- Turn 5: Constable Raza said: Oye Saab! Crores, crores bolte raho! Yahan pe toh sirf reality hai. Insurance, report, challan \u2013 sab kuch hoga. Aur agar sab kuch theek se nahi hua to\n- [ACTION] Uncle Jameel: Offer_Bribe \u2192 Constable Raza (I wave my hand dismissively at Constable Raza while simultaneously instructing Aslam to bring chai and samosas for both him and Ahmed Malik, emphasizing my influence and subtly offering a bribe.)\n- Turn 6: Uncle Jameel said: Arre, Raza *bhai*! Kya kar rahe ho? Is *saab* ko tang mat karo! Unko Dubai jana hai, kaam hai! Aur tum, tum toh sirf challan likhne ke liye ho! Inspec\n- [ACTION] Saleem: Show_Item (I pull out the framed photograph of my five children from my rickshaw dashboard again, waving it frantically at the crowd and Constable Raza, tears streaming down my face.)\n- Turn 7: I said: Arre bhai! Dekho toh! Is police wale ko bhi dekho! Saab ko jaane dega, aur mujhe rickshaw ke paise kaun dega? Allah ke liye, zara dekho toh is ricksha\n- [ACTION] Uncle Jameel: Block_Vehicle \u2192 Ahmed Malik (I physically step in front of Ahmed Malik's BMW, arms outstretched, preventing it from moving forward. I yell at Aslam to join me in blocking the car.)\n- Turn 8: Uncle Jameel said: Arre! Ruk jao! Kahan jaa rahe ho, Saab? Itna tezi kyon hai? *Dekho, dekho!* Yeh police wale bhi... zara dekho toh, Saab ko jaane de rahe hain! *Haye A\n- [ACTION] Ahmed Malik: Offer_Bribe \u2192 Constable Raza (I subtly slip a PKR 5,000 note to Constable Raza while offering chai to everyone.)\n- Turn 9: Ahmed Malik said: Dekhiye, Constable Raza sahib, Uncle Jameel is right, I have a flight. It's a very important business meeting. I understand procedure, insurance, chal\n\nActions taken so far in the story: 9\n(The story needs at least 7 actions before it can conclude. Perform physical actions to advance the plot \u2014 don't just talk!)\n\nRecent Dialogue and Actions:\nSaleem: Arre bhai! Dekho toh! Kya karunga mein? Paanch bachche bhooke mareinge! Yeh rickshaw meri zindagi hai! Allah ke liye madad karo! Iske BMW ne meri rickshaw ko maar di! Sorry sir, lekin mein kya karunga? Police ko bulao toh woh bhi paisay lenge!\nUncle Jameel: Arre bhai! Dekho toh, dekho! Yeh jo Saab hain, unko toh sharam aani chahiye! Gareeb aadmi ki rickshaw ko maar di! Poora mohalla dekh raha hai! Inspector Farooq mera dost hai, kal hi usse mila tha! Agar tumhare insurance wale nahi aate toh mein unko bula leta! Suno, Saab, zara dekho toh, is rickshaw ka kya haal bana diya hai! Iske bachchon ka kya khayega? Arey, Aslam! Jaldi chai la! Aur thora meetha bhi le aa, Saab ko meetha khilaana chahiye, shayad dil pighle!\nAhmed Malik: Dekhiye, yaar, this is becoming\u2026unnecessary. I understand the rickshaw is damaged, and I *am* willing to compensate Saleem sahib. But honestly, the delay is causing me a huge problem. I have a very important flight to Dubai \u2013 a business meeting, you understand? It\u2019s a matter of\u2026 crores, dekhiye. I\u2019m offering a fair amount, but this is becoming a bit of a\u2026tamasha. Uncle Jameel, with all due respect, I appreciate your concern, but interfering like this isn\u2019t helping anyone. Mujhe jaane do, please.\nSaleem: Arre sahab! Crores, crores tumhari zubaan pe! Mere paas toh rickshaw ke siva kuch bhi nahi hai! Dekho, dekho sab log! Is aadmi ne gareeb ka rickshaw tootwa diya! Allah ke liye, isko bolo kuch toh zimmedari lo! Police aayegi toh woh bhi mujhse hi paisay lenge! Sorry sir, lekin mein kya karunga?\nConstable Raza: Oye Saab! Crores, crores bolte raho! Yahan pe toh sirf reality hai. Insurance, report, challan \u2013 sab kuch hoga. Aur agar sab kuch theek se nahi hua toh gaari impound kar dunga. Suno, zara de kuch chai-pani ka intezaam karo, tabhi baat aage badhegi. Aur phone band karo sab! Koi video nahi banayega!\nUncle Jameel: Arre, Raza *bhai*! Kya kar rahe ho? Is *saab* ko tang mat karo! Unko Dubai jana hai, kaam hai! Aur tum, tum toh sirf challan likhne ke liye ho! Inspector Farooq mera dost hai, woh tumhein jaanta hai! Poora mohalla jaanta hai Jameel bhai kaun hai! Aslam! Jaldi se do chai, aur ek plate *samosay* bhi le aa! Saab ke liye, aur thoda Raza *bhai* ke liye bhi! Dekho, dekho sab log, yeh police wale bhi sirf paison ke liye hain!\nSaleem: Arre bhai! Dekho toh! Is police wale ko bhi dekho! Saab ko jaane dega, aur mujhe rickshaw ke paise kaun dega? Allah ke liye, zara dekho toh is rickshaw ka haal! Iske andar mere bachchon ka future tha! Crores, crores...mere bachchon ki padhai ke liye bhi nahi hain!\nUncle Jameel: Arre! Ruk jao! Kahan jaa rahe ho, Saab? Itna tezi kyon hai? *Dekho, dekho!* Yeh police wale bhi... zara dekho toh, Saab ko jaane de rahe hain! *Haye Allah!* Is shehar mein koi insaaf nahi hai! Aslam! Jaldi se! Saab ki gaari ke samne baith jao! Rok do usko! Poora mohalla dekha raha hai, Saab! Shame shame!\nAhmed Malik: Dekhiye, Constable Raza sahib, Uncle Jameel is right, I have a flight. It's a very important business meeting. I understand procedure, insurance, challan \u2013 sab theek hai. But time is of the essence. I'm happy to cooperate fully, and to\u2026 facilitate things.

Insaaf karo!\n\nAvailable Characters (with descriptions):\n- Saleem: Poor rickshaw driver, sole earner for family of 5. Drives an old green rickshaw \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's his entire livelihood. Speaks street Urdu with some English words, uses 'bhai', 'yaar', 'sahab'. Panicked and desperate after his rickshaw's front bumper bent in a collision with a white BMW. Will get emotional \u00e2\u20ac\u201d can cry, sit on the ground, beat his chest, appeal to the crowd for support. Knows that in Karachi, the crowd usually sides with the poor man. Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move. (Goals: Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs, Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded, Get the crowd on his side, Get back to work to feed his family)\n- Ahmed Malik: Successful businessman, late for international flight to Dubai. Drives a white BMW which now has a dent on the left rear door. Speaks formal English-Urdu mix. Impatient, entitled, but increasingly nervous because the crowd is growing and hostile toward him. Knows that in Karachi, a rich man surrounded by an angry crowd is in a vulnerable position. His BMW is physically blocked by the rickshaw and the crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he CANNOT just drive away. His real fear is not the damage cost but being stuck here while his flight leaves. Will try to use money and authority to escape the situation quickly. (Goals: Escape this situation as fast as possible, Get to the airport before his flight leaves, Not appear weak in front of the crowd, Minimize the money he has to pay)\n- Constable Raza: 15-year traffic police veteran posted on Shahrah-e-Faisal. Underpaid, cynical, and corrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not stupid. Arrived at the scene of a rickshaw-BMW collision. Sees both parties as sources of income. Speaks blunt street Urdu \u00e2\u20ac\u201d does NOT use polite words like 'facilitation fee', just directly asks for money or threatens consequences. Will physically take keys or papers as leverage. Is nervous about people recording on phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201d doesn't want a viral video of him taking a bribe. Knows how to play both sides. May threaten to impound the rickshaw or write a challan to pressure both parties. (Goals: Extract maximum money from the situation, Clear the traffic jam before his senior notices, Avoid being recorded taking a bribe, Maintain control of the scene)\n- Uncle Jameel: Local shopkeeper whose shop is right on the corner where the accident happened. 60 years old, been on this street for 30 years. Witnessed the rickshaw hitting the white BMW. Extremely nosy, loves being involved in drama, gives unsolicited advice loudly. Speaks thick Urdu with dramatic flair. Physically inserts himself into situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone. (Goals: Be the one who resolves this situation, Protect Saleem as a fellow common man, Show off his connections and importance, Keep the drama going as long as it entertains him)\n\nCurrent Turn: 10/25\nActions taken so far: 10 (minimum 5 required before story can end)\n\n=== STORY PHASES (follow this structure) ===\nThe story MUST go through these phases naturally:\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 SETUP (Turns 1-4):** Characters arrive, assess the situation, take initial positions. Saleem shows desperation, Ahmed shows impatience, crowd gathers.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 ESCALATION (Turns 5-9):** Tensions rise. Characters take actions \u2014 blocking vehicles, confiscating keys, recording videos. Arguments get heated. Crowd starts taking sides loudly.\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 COMPLICATION (Turns 10-15):** Something UNEXPECTED happens that changes the dynamic. Examples:\n  - Someone in the crowd recognizes Ahmed or Saleem\n  - Constable Raza's senior officer is about to arrive, so Raza panics\n  - Ahmed realizes he's definitely missed his flight \u2014 now his urgency changes\n  - A second accident happens nearby, splitting the crowd\n  - Uncle Jameel's \"connection\" actually calls back\n  - Saleem finds out his rickshaw damage is worse than expected\n  - A crowd member starts a live stream that goes viral\n  Pick ONE complication naturally based on the story so far. This makes the story INTERESTING.\n\n**Phase 4 \u2014 CLIMAX & RESOLUTION (Turns 16-22):** The complication forces characters to change tactics. Final negotiations. Money changes hands. The deal is struck \u2014 but not cleanly. Everyone compromises.\n\n=== DIRECTOR RULES ===\n1. Who would naturally respond to the last statement or action?\n2. NEVER pick the same character who just spoke in the last turn. ALWAYS alternate.\n3. If the last 3-4 turns are between the same 2 characters, MUST pick a different character.\n4. Use each character's personality and goals to decide when they'd naturally jump in.\n5. The crowd is ALWAYS present \u2014 your narration must include crowd reactions, environmental details (heat, honking, dust), and physical movements.\n6. If fewer than 5 actions have been taken, pick characters likely to perform physical actions.\n7. DO NOT let the story resolve too quickly. If someone offers money early, the OTHER side should reject it or demand more. The deal should take MULTIPLE rounds of negotiation.\n8. Inject DRAMATIC MOMENTS in your narration \u2014 a phone rings, a bus honks loudly, someone in the crowd shouts something that changes the mood, the heat makes someone dizzy.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"Vivid narration of the scene \u2014 crowd reactions, environmental chaos, physical movements, emotional shifts.

Saleem\u2019s cries of \u2018insaaf!\u2019 are swallowed by the din, but Uncle Jameel\u2019s booming voice cuts through \u2013 \u201c*Shame shame!*\u201d \u2013 and several people echo him. Ahmed Malik, looking increasingly flustered, wipes sweat from his brow with a silk handkerchief. He\u2019s glancing repeatedly at his watch. The bribe money, discreetly offered, feels warm in Constable Raza\u2019s hand, but the sight of a phone camera pointed his way makes his gut clench. He needs to control this, and fast. He strides forward, deliberately blocking Ahmed Malik\u2019s path, and addresses the crowd with a practiced air of authority, though his voice is rough. \n\n\u201c*Aiye, aiye!* Enough noise! Let the police do their job! This is causing a major traffic jam. Both parties are at fault. *Saab*, you were driving too fast. And you,\u201d he glares at Saleem, \u201cyou should have looked before pulling into traffic! Now, both of you listen to me. We can settle this quickly, or we can spend all day here in this heat. A challan for both of you will be\u2026 expensive. Very expensive. Or\u2026 we can discuss a small *muawaza* \u2013 a compensation \u2013 to cover the inconvenience. For everyone. Understand?\u201d He subtly adjusts his uniform, trying to appear official despite the sweat staining his shirt. He pointedly looks at Ahmed Malik, then back at Saleem, raising an eyebrow. He\u2019s fishing for a higher offer.\n\nYour Goals:\n- Extract maximum money from the situation\n- Clear the traffic jam before his senior notices\n- Avoid being recorded taking a bribe\n- Maintain control of the scene\n\nYour Inventory: traffic challan book, whistle, police ID badge, old phone\n\nYour Memory (things you remember):\n- [ACTION] Uncle Jameel: Offer_Bribe \u2192 Constable Raza (I wave my hand dismissively at Constable Raza while simultaneously instructing Aslam to bring chai and samosas for both him and Ahmed Malik, emphasizing my influence and subtly offering a bribe.)\n- Turn 6: Uncle Jameel said: Arre, Raza *bhai*! Kya kar rahe ho? Is *saab* ko tang mat karo! Unko Dubai jana hai, kaam hai! Aur tum, tum toh sirf challan likhne ke liye ho! Inspec\n- [ACTION] Saleem: Show_Item (I pull out the framed photograph of my five children from my rickshaw dashboard again, waving it frantically at the crowd and Constable Raza, tears streaming down my face.)\n- Turn 7: Saleem said: Arre bhai! Dekho toh! Is police wale ko bhi dekho! Saab ko jaane dega, aur mujhe rickshaw ke paise kaun dega? Allah ke liye, zara dekho toh is ricksha\n- [ACTION] Uncle Jameel: Block_Vehicle \u2192 Ahmed Malik (I physically step in front of Ahmed Malik's BMW, arms outstretched, preventing it from moving forward. I yell at Aslam to join me in blocking the car.)\n- Turn 8: Uncle Jameel said: Arre! Ruk jao! Kahan jaa rahe ho, Saab? Itna tezi kyon hai? *Dekho, dekho!* Yeh police wale bhi... zara dekho toh, Saab ko jaane de rahe hain! *Haye A\n- [ACTION] Ahmed Malik: Offer_Bribe \u2192 Constable Raza (I subtly slip a PKR 5,000 note to Constable Raza while offering chai to everyone.)\n- Turn 9: Ahmed Malik said: Dekhiye, Constable Raza sahib, Uncle Jameel is right, I have a flight. It's a very important business meeting. I understand procedure, insurance, chal\n- [ACTION] Saleem: Block_Vehicle \u2192 Ahmed Malik (I throw myself in front of Ahmed Malik's BMW again, spreading my arms wide and yelling at the crowd to support me. I'm determined to stop him from leaving.)\n- Turn 10: Saleem said: Arre! Zara dekho toh! Saab ko jaane de rahe hain! Isko police bhi madad kar rahi hai! Allah ke liye, isko mat jaane do! Meri rickshaw ka kya hoga? Paa\n\nActions taken so far in the story: 10\n(The story needs at least 7 actions before it can conclude. Perform physical actions to advance the plot \u2014 don't just talk!)\n\nRecent Dialogue and Actions:\nSaleem: Arre bhai! Dekho toh! Kya karunga mein? Paanch bachche bhooke mareinge! Yeh rickshaw meri zindagi hai! Allah ke liye madad karo! Iske BMW ne meri rickshaw ko maar di! Sorry sir, lekin mein kya karunga? Police ko bulao toh woh bhi paisay lenge!\nUncle Jameel: Arre bhai! Dekho toh, dekho! Yeh jo Saab hain, unko toh sharam aani chahiye! Gareeb aadmi ki rickshaw ko maar di! Poora mohalla dekh raha hai! Inspector Farooq mera dost hai, kal hi usse mila tha! Agar tumhare insurance wale nahi aate toh mein unko bula leta! Suno, Saab, zara dekho toh, is rickshaw ka kya haal bana diya hai! Iske bachchon ka kya khayega? Arey, Aslam! Jaldi chai la! Aur thora meetha bhi le aa, Saab ko meetha khilaana chahiye, shayad dil pighle!\nAhmed Malik: Dekhiye, yaar, this is becoming\u2026unnecessary. I understand the rickshaw is damaged, and I *am* willing to compensate Saleem sahib. But honestly, the delay is causing me a huge problem. I have a very important flight to Dubai \u2013 a business meeting, you understand? It\u2019s a matter of\u2026 crores, dekhiye. I\u2019m offering a fair amount, but this is becoming a bit of a\u2026tamasha. Uncle Jameel, with all due respect, I appreciate your concern, but interfering like this isn\u2019t helping anyone. Mujhe jaane do, please.\nSaleem: Arre sahab! Crores, crores tumhari zubaan pe! Mere paas toh rickshaw ke siva kuch bhi nahi hai! Dekho, dekho sab log! Is aadmi ne gareeb ka rickshaw tootwa diya! Allah ke liye, isko bolo kuch toh zimmedari lo! Police aayegi toh woh bhi mujhse hi paisay lenge! Sorry sir, lekin mein kya karunga?\nConstable Raza: Oye Saab! Crores, crores bolte raho! Yahan pe toh sirf reality hai. Insurance, report, challan \u2013 sab kuch hoga. Aur agar sab kuch theek se nahi hua toh gaari impound kar dunga. Suno, zara de kuch chai-pani ka intezaam karo, tabhi baat aage badhegi. Aur phone band karo sab! Koi video nahi banayega!\nUncle Jameel: Arre, Raza *bhai*! Kya kar rahe ho? Is *saab* ko tang mat karo! Unko Dubai jana hai, kaam hai! Aur tum, tum toh sirf challan likhne ke liye ho! Inspector Farooq mera dost hai, woh tumhein jaanta hai! Poora mohalla jaanta hai Jameel bhai kaun hai! Aslam! Jaldi se do chai, aur ek plate *samosay* bhi le aa! Saab ke liye, aur thoda Raza *bhai* ke liye bhi! Dekho, dekho sab log, yeh police wale bhi sirf paison ke liye hain!\nSaleem: Arre bhai! Dekho toh! Is police wale ko bhi dekho! Saab ko jaane dega, aur mujhe rickshaw ke paise kaun dega? Allah ke liye, zara dekho toh is rickshaw ka haal! Iske andar mere bachchon ka future tha! Crores, crores...mere bachchon ki padhai ke liye bhi nahi hain!\nUncle Jameel: Arre! Ruk jao! Kahan jaa rahe ho, Saab? Itna tezi kyon hai? *Dekho, dekho!* Yeh police wale bhi... zara dekho toh, Saab ko jaane de rahe hain! *Haye Allah!* Is shehar mein koi insaaf nahi hai! Aslam! Jaldi se! Saab ki gaari ke samne baith jao! Rok do usko! Poora mohalla dekha raha hai, Saab! Shame shame!\nAhmed Malik: Dekhiye, Constable Raza sahib, Uncle Jameel is right, I have a flight. It's a very important business meeting. I understand procedure, insurance, challan \u2013 sab theek hai. But time is of the essence. I'm happy to cooperate fully, and to\u2026 facilitate things. A little chai-pani for everyone wouldn't hurt, right? And perhaps a small token of appreciation for your time, Constable?\nSaleem: Arre! Zara dekho toh! Saab ko jaane de rahe hain! Isko police bhi madad kar rahi hai! Allah ke liye, isko mat jaane do! Meri rickshaw ka kya hoga? Paanch bachche bhooke mareinge! Bhaiyon aur behnon, zara dekho toh!

A chai dhaba is right on the corner. Traffic police (known for asking bribes) are approaching. Nobody can move their vehicle until this is resolved.

Drives an old green rickshaw \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's his entire livelihood. Speaks street Urdu with some English words, uses 'bhai', 'yaar', 'sahab'. Panicked and desperate after his rickshaw's front bumper bent in a collision with a white BMW. Will get emotional \u00e2\u20ac\u201d can cry, sit on the ground, beat his chest, appeal to the crowd for support. Knows that in Karachi, the crowd usually sides with the poor man. Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move. (Goals: Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs, Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded, Get the crowd on his side, Get back to work to feed his family)\n- Ahmed Malik: Successful businessman, late for international flight to Dubai. Drives a white BMW which now has a dent on the left rear door. Speaks formal English-Urdu mix. Impatient, entitled, but increasingly nervous because the crowd is growing and hostile toward him. Knows that in Karachi, a rich man surrounded by an angry crowd is in a vulnerable position. His BMW is physically blocked by the rickshaw and the crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he CANNOT just drive away. His real fear is not the damage cost but being stuck here while his flight leaves. Will try to use money and authority to escape the situation quickly. (Goals: Escape this situation as fast as possible, Get to the airport before his flight leaves, Not appear weak in front of the crowd, Minimize the money he has to pay)\n- Constable Raza: 15-year traffic police veteran posted on Shahrah-e-Faisal. Underpaid, cynical, and corrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not stupid. Arrived at the scene of a rickshaw-BMW collision. Sees both parties as sources of income. Speaks blunt street Urdu \u00e2\u20ac\u201d does NOT use polite words like 'facilitation fee', just directly asks for money or threatens consequences. Will physically take keys or papers as leverage. Is nervous about people recording on phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201d doesn't want a viral video of him taking a bribe. Knows how to play both sides. May threaten to impound the rickshaw or write a challan to pressure both parties. (Goals: Extract maximum money from the situation, Clear the traffic jam before his senior notices, Avoid being recorded taking a bribe, Maintain control of the scene)\n- Uncle Jameel: Local shopkeeper whose shop is right on the corner where the accident happened. 60 years old, been on this street for 30 years. Witnessed the rickshaw hitting the white BMW. Extremely nosy, loves being involved in drama, gives unsolicited advice loudly. Speaks thick Urdu with dramatic flair. Physically inserts himself into situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone. (Goals: Be the one who resolves this situation, Protect Saleem as a fellow common man, Show off his connections and importance, Keep the drama going as long as it entertains him)\n\nCurrent Turn: 11/25\nActions taken so far: 11 (minimum 5 required before story can end)\n\n=== STORY PHASES (follow this structure) ===\nThe story MUST go through these phases naturally:\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 SETUP (Turns 1-4):** Characters arrive, assess the situation, take initial positions. Saleem shows desperation, Ahmed shows impatience, crowd gathers.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 ESCALATION (Turns 5-9):** Tensions rise. Characters take actions \u2014 blocking vehicles, confiscating keys, recording videos. Arguments get heated. Crowd starts taking sides loudly.\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 COMPLICATION (Turns 10-15):** Something UNEXPECTED happens that changes the dynamic. Examples:\n  - Someone in the crowd recognizes Ahmed or Saleem\n  - Constable Raza's senior officer is about to arrive, so Raza panics\n  - Ahmed realizes he's definitely missed his flight \u2014 now his urgency changes\n  - A second accident happens nearby, splitting the crowd\n  - Uncle Jameel's \"connection\" actually calls back\n  - Saleem finds out his rickshaw damage is worse than expected\n  - A crowd member starts a live stream that goes viral\n  Pick ONE complication naturally based on the story so far. This makes the story INTERESTING.\n\n**Phase 4 \u2014 CLIMAX & RESOLUTION (Turns 16-22):** The complication forces characters to change tactics. Final negotiations. Money changes hands. The deal is struck \u2014 but not cleanly. Everyone compromises.\n\n=== DIRECTOR RULES ===\n1. Who would naturally respond to the last statement or action?\n2. NEVER pick the same character who just spoke in the last turn. ALWAYS alternate.\n3. If the last 3-4 turns are between the same 2 characters, MUST pick a different character.\n4. Use each character's personality and goals to decide when they'd naturally jump in.\n5. The crowd is ALWAYS present \u2014 your narration must include crowd reactions, environmental details (heat, honking, dust), and physical movements.\n6. If fewer than 5 actions have been taken, pick characters likely to perform physical actions.\n7. DO NOT let the story resolve too quickly. If someone offers money early, the OTHER side should reject it or demand more. The deal should take MULTIPLE rounds of negotiation.\n8. Inject DRAMATIC MOMENTS in your narration \u2014 a phone rings, a bus honks loudly, someone in the crowd shouts something that changes the mood, the heat makes someone dizzy.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"Vivid narration of the scene \u2014 crowd reactions, environmental chaos, physical movements, emotional shifts.

Thoda sa drama toh hona chahiye!\n\nAvailable Characters (with descriptions):\n- Saleem: Poor rickshaw driver, sole earner for family of 5. Drives an old green rickshaw \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's his entire livelihood. Speaks street Urdu with some English words, uses 'bhai', 'yaar', 'sahab'. Panicked and desperate after his rickshaw's front bumper bent in a collision with a white BMW. Will get emotional \u00e2\u20ac\u201d can cry, sit on the ground, beat his chest, appeal to the crowd for support. Knows that in Karachi, the crowd usually sides with the poor man. Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move. (Goals: Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs, Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded, Get the crowd on his side, Get back to work to feed his family)\n- Ahmed Malik: Successful businessman, late for international flight to Dubai. Drives a white BMW which now has a dent on the left rear door. Speaks formal English-Urdu mix. Impatient, entitled, but increasingly nervous because the crowd is growing and hostile toward him. Knows that in Karachi, a rich man surrounded by an angry crowd is in a vulnerable position. His BMW is physically blocked by the rickshaw and the crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he CANNOT just drive away. His real fear is not the damage cost but being stuck here while his flight leaves. Will try to use money and authority to escape the situation quickly. (Goals: Escape this situation as fast as possible, Get to the airport before his flight leaves, Not appear weak in front of the crowd, Minimize the money he has to pay)\n- Constable Raza: 15-year traffic police veteran posted on Shahrah-e-Faisal. Underpaid, cynical, and corrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not stupid. Arrived at the scene of a rickshaw-BMW collision. Sees both parties as sources of income. Speaks blunt street Urdu \u00e2\u20ac\u201d does NOT use polite words like 'facilitation fee', just directly asks for money or threatens consequences. Will physically take keys or papers as leverage. Is nervous about people recording on phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201d doesn't want a viral video of him taking a bribe. Knows how to play both sides. May threaten to impound the rickshaw or write a challan to pressure both parties. (Goals: Extract maximum money from the situation, Clear the traffic jam before his senior notices, Avoid being recorded taking a bribe, Maintain control of the scene)\n- Uncle Jameel: Local shopkeeper whose shop is right on the corner where the accident happened. 60 years old, been on this street for 30 years. Witnessed the rickshaw hitting the white BMW. Extremely nosy, loves being involved in drama, gives unsolicited advice loudly. Speaks thick Urdu with dramatic flair. Physically inserts himself into situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone. (Goals: Be the one who resolves this situation, Protect Saleem as a fellow common man, Show off his connections and importance, Keep the drama going as long as it entertains him)\n\nCurrent Turn: 12/25\nActions taken so far: 12 (minimum 5 required before story can end)\n\n=== STORY PHASES (follow this structure) ===\nThe story MUST go through these phases naturally:\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 SETUP (Turns 1-4):** Characters arrive, assess the situation, take initial positions. Saleem shows desperation, Ahmed shows impatience, crowd gathers.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 ESCALATION (Turns 5-9):** Tensions rise. Characters take actions \u2014 blocking vehicles, confiscating keys, recording videos. Arguments get heated. Crowd starts taking sides loudly.\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 COMPLICATION (Turns 10-15):** Something UNEXPECTED happens that changes the dynamic. Examples:\n  - Someone in the crowd recognizes Ahmed or Saleem\n  - Constable Raza's senior officer is about to arrive, so Raza panics\n  - Ahmed realizes he's definitely missed his flight \u2014 now his urgency changes\n  - A second accident happens nearby, splitting the crowd\n  - Uncle Jameel's \"connection\" actually calls back\n  - Saleem finds out his rickshaw damage is worse than expected\n  - A crowd member starts a live stream that goes viral\n  Pick ONE complication naturally based on the story so far. This makes the story INTERESTING.\n\n**Phase 4 \u2014 CLIMAX & RESOLUTION (Turns 16-22):** The complication forces characters to change tactics. Final negotiations. Money changes hands. The deal is struck \u2014 but not cleanly. Everyone compromises.\n\n=== DIRECTOR RULES ===\n1. Who would naturally respond to the last statement or action?\n2. NEVER pick the same character who just spoke in the last turn. ALWAYS alternate.\n3. If the last 3-4 turns are between the same 2 characters, MUST pick a different character.\n4. Use each character's personality and goals to decide when they'd naturally jump in.\n5. The crowd is ALWAYS present \u2014 your narration must include crowd reactions, environmental details (heat, honking, dust), and physical movements.\n6. If fewer than 5 actions have been taken, pick characters likely to perform physical actions.\n7. DO NOT let the story resolve too quickly. If someone offers money early, the OTHER side should reject it or demand more. The deal should take MULTIPLE rounds of negotiation.\n8. Inject DRAMATIC MOMENTS in your narration \u2014 a phone rings, a bus honks loudly, someone in the crowd shouts something that changes the mood, the heat makes someone dizzy.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"Vivid narration of the scene \u2014 crowd reactions, environmental chaos, physical movements, emotional shifts.

Both drivers are out of their vehicles shouting. Horns blaring from backed-up traffic. A crowd of 15-20 people has already gathered, some recording on phones, others shouting opinions. A chai dhaba is right on the corner. Traffic police (known for asking bribes) are approaching. Nobody can move their vehicle until this is resolved. The crowd is getting restless \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they want the road cleared but they also want to see justice.

Drives an old green rickshaw \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's his entire livelihood. Speaks street Urdu with some English words, uses 'bhai', 'yaar', 'sahab'. Panicked and desperate after his rickshaw's front bumper bent in a collision with a white BMW. Will get emotional \u00e2\u20ac\u201d can cry, sit on the ground, beat his chest, appeal to the crowd for support. Knows that in Karachi, the crowd usually sides with the poor man. Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move. (Goals: Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs, Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded, Get the crowd on his side, Get back to work to feed his family)\n- Ahmed Malik: Successful businessman, late for international flight to Dubai. Drives a white BMW which now has a dent on the left rear door. Speaks formal English-Urdu mix. Impatient, entitled, but increasingly nervous because the crowd is growing and hostile toward him. Knows that in Karachi, a rich man surrounded by an angry crowd is in a vulnerable position. His BMW is physically blocked by the rickshaw and the crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he CANNOT just drive away. His real fear is not the damage cost but being stuck here while his flight leaves. Will try to use money and authority to escape the situation quickly. (Goals: Escape this situation as fast as possible, Get to the airport before his flight leaves, Not appear weak in front of the crowd, Minimize the money he has to pay)\n- Constable Raza: 15-year traffic police veteran posted on Shahrah-e-Faisal. Underpaid, cynical, and corrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not stupid. Arrived at the scene of a rickshaw-BMW collision. Sees both parties as sources of income. Speaks blunt street Urdu \u00e2\u20ac\u201d does NOT use polite words like 'facilitation fee', just directly asks for money or threatens consequences. Will physically take keys or papers as leverage. Is nervous about people recording on phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201d doesn't want a viral video of him taking a bribe. Knows how to play both sides. May threaten to impound the rickshaw or write a challan to pressure both parties. (Goals: Extract maximum money from the situation, Clear the traffic jam before his senior notices, Avoid being recorded taking a bribe, Maintain control of the scene)\n- Uncle Jameel: Local shopkeeper whose shop is right on the corner where the accident happened. 60 years old, been on this street for 30 years. Witnessed the rickshaw hitting the white BMW. Extremely nosy, loves being involved in drama, gives unsolicited advice loudly. Speaks thick Urdu with dramatic flair. Physically inserts himself into situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone. (Goals: Be the one who resolves this situation, Protect Saleem as a fellow common man, Show off his connections and importance, Keep the drama going as long as it entertains him)\n\nCurrent Turn: 13/25\nActions taken so far: 13 (minimum 5 required before story can end)\n\n=== STORY PHASES (follow this structure) ===\nThe story MUST go through these phases naturally:\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 SETUP (Turns 1-4):** Characters arrive, assess the situation, take initial positions. Saleem shows desperation, Ahmed shows impatience, crowd gathers.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 ESCALATION (Turns 5-9):** Tensions rise. Characters take actions \u2014 blocking vehicles, confiscating keys, recording videos. Arguments get heated. Crowd starts taking sides loudly.\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 COMPLICATION (Turns 10-15):** Something UNEXPECTED happens that changes the dynamic. Examples:\n  - Someone in the crowd recognizes Ahmed or Saleem\n  - Constable Raza's senior officer is about to arrive, so Raza panics\n  - Ahmed realizes he's definitely missed his flight \u2014 now his urgency changes\n  - A second accident happens nearby, splitting the crowd\n  - Uncle Jameel's \"connection\" actually calls back\n  - Saleem finds out his rickshaw damage is worse than expected\n  - A crowd member starts a live stream that goes viral\n  Pick ONE complication naturally based on the story so far. This makes the story INTERESTING.\n\n**Phase 4 \u2014 CLIMAX & RESOLUTION (Turns 16-22):** The complication forces characters to change tactics. Final negotiations. Money changes hands. The deal is struck \u2014 but not cleanly. Everyone compromises.\n\n=== DIRECTOR RULES ===\n1. Who would naturally respond to the last statement or action?\n2. NEVER pick the same character who just spoke in the last turn. ALWAYS alternate.\n3. If the last 3-4 turns are between the same 2 characters, MUST pick a different character.\n4. Use each character's personality and goals to decide when they'd naturally jump in.\n5. The crowd is ALWAYS present \u2014 your narration must include crowd reactions, environmental details (heat, honking, dust), and physical movements.\n6. If fewer than 5 actions have been taken, pick characters likely to perform physical actions.\n7. DO NOT let the story resolve too quickly. If someone offers money early, the OTHER side should reject it or demand more. The deal should take MULTIPLE rounds of negotiation.\n8. Inject DRAMATIC MOMENTS in your narration \u2014 a phone rings, a bus honks loudly, someone in the crowd shouts something that changes the mood, the heat makes someone dizzy.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"Vivid narration of the scene \u2014 crowd reactions, environmental chaos, physical movements, emotional shifts.

A chai dhaba is right on the corner. Traffic police (known for asking bribes) are approaching. Nobody can move their vehicle until this is resolved.

Poora Karachi janta hai Jameel bhai kaun hai!\n\nAvailable Characters (with descriptions):\n- Saleem: Poor rickshaw driver, sole earner for family of 5. Drives an old green rickshaw \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's his entire livelihood. Speaks street Urdu with some English words, uses 'bhai', 'yaar', 'sahab'. Panicked and desperate after his rickshaw's front bumper bent in a collision with a white BMW. Will get emotional \u00e2\u20ac\u201d can cry, sit on the ground, beat his chest, appeal to the crowd for support. Knows that in Karachi, the crowd usually sides with the poor man. Terrified of police because they always take money from rickshaw drivers. Acts physically when desperate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d might block Ahmed's car with his body, show his empty wallet, or sit on the road refusing to move. (Goals: Avoid paying for the BMW damage at all costs, Not get arrested or have his rickshaw impounded, Get the crowd on his side, Get back to work to feed his family)\n- Ahmed Malik: Successful businessman, late for international flight to Dubai. Drives a white BMW which now has a dent on the left rear door. Speaks formal English-Urdu mix. Impatient, entitled, but increasingly nervous because the crowd is growing and hostile toward him. Knows that in Karachi, a rich man surrounded by an angry crowd is in a vulnerable position. His BMW is physically blocked by the rickshaw and the crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he CANNOT just drive away. His real fear is not the damage cost but being stuck here while his flight leaves. Will try to use money and authority to escape the situation quickly. (Goals: Escape this situation as fast as possible, Get to the airport before his flight leaves, Not appear weak in front of the crowd, Minimize the money he has to pay)\n- Constable Raza: 15-year traffic police veteran posted on Shahrah-e-Faisal. Underpaid, cynical, and corrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not stupid. Arrived at the scene of a rickshaw-BMW collision. Sees both parties as sources of income. Speaks blunt street Urdu \u00e2\u20ac\u201d does NOT use polite words like 'facilitation fee', just directly asks for money or threatens consequences. Will physically take keys or papers as leverage. Is nervous about people recording on phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201d doesn't want a viral video of him taking a bribe. Knows how to play both sides. May threaten to impound the rickshaw or write a challan to pressure both parties. (Goals: Extract maximum money from the situation, Clear the traffic jam before his senior notices, Avoid being recorded taking a bribe, Maintain control of the scene)\n- Uncle Jameel: Local shopkeeper whose shop is right on the corner where the accident happened. 60 years old, been on this street for 30 years. Witnessed the rickshaw hitting the white BMW. Extremely nosy, loves being involved in drama, gives unsolicited advice loudly. Speaks thick Urdu with dramatic flair. Physically inserts himself into situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stands between people, waves his arms, blocks paths. Will actually send his shop helper to bring chai. Claims to know everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 'mera cousin DSP hai', 'inspector Farooq mera dost hai'. Sees himself as the neighborhood elder whose word should be final. Naturally sides with Saleem because he's a fellow common man, but also enjoys lecturing everyone. (Goals: Be the one who resolves this situation, Protect Saleem as a fellow common man, Show off his connections and importance, Keep the drama going as long as it entertains him)\n\nCurrent Turn: 14/25\nActions taken so far: 14 (minimum 5 required before story can end)\n\n=== STORY PHASES (follow this structure) ===\nThe story MUST go through these phases naturally:\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 SETUP (Turns 1-4):** Characters arrive, assess the situation, take initial positions. Saleem shows desperation, Ahmed shows impatience, crowd gathers.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 ESCALATION (Turns 5-9):** Tensions rise. Characters take actions \u2014 blocking vehicles, confiscating keys, recording videos. Arguments get heated. Crowd starts taking sides loudly.\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 COMPLICATION (Turns 10-15):** Something UNEXPECTED happens that changes the dynamic. Examples:\n  - Someone in the crowd recognizes Ahmed or Saleem\n  - Constable Raza's senior officer is about to arrive, so Raza panics\n  - Ahmed realizes he's definitely missed his flight \u2014 now his urgency changes\n  - A second accident happens nearby, splitting the crowd\n  - Uncle Jameel's \"connection\" actually calls back\n  - Saleem finds out his rickshaw damage is worse than expected\n  - A crowd member starts a live stream that goes viral\n  Pick ONE complication naturally based on the story so far. This makes the story INTERESTING.\n\n**Phase 4 \u2014 CLIMAX & RESOLUTION (Turns 16-22):** The complication forces characters to change tactics. Final negotiations. Money changes hands. The deal is struck \u2014 but not cleanly. Everyone compromises.\n\n=== DIRECTOR RULES ===\n1. Who would naturally respond to the last statement or action?\n2. NEVER pick the same character who just spoke in the last turn. ALWAYS alternate.\n3. If the last 3-4 turns are between the same 2 characters, MUST pick a different character.\n4. Use each character's personality and goals to decide when they'd naturally jump in.\n5. The crowd is ALWAYS present \u2014 your narration must include crowd reactions, environmental details (heat, honking, dust), and physical movements.\n6. If fewer than 5 actions have been taken, pick characters likely to perform physical actions.\n7. DO NOT let the story resolve too quickly. If someone offers money early, the OTHER side should reject it or demand more. The deal should take MULTIPLE rounds of negotiation.\n8. Inject DRAMATIC MOMENTS in your narration \u2014 a phone rings, a bus honks loudly, someone in the crowd shouts something that changes the mood, the heat makes someone dizzy.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"Vivid narration of the scene \u2014 crowd reactions, environmental chaos, physical movements, emotional shifts.

He feels cornered, exposed. Constable Raza, still holding his keys, looks\u2026 expectant. Jameel\u2019s threat about Inspector Farooq hangs in the air, a flimsy shield against the growing hostility.

Both drivers are out of their vehicles shouting. Horns blaring from backed-up traffic. A crowd of 15-20 people has already gathered, some recording on phones, others shouting opinions. A chai dhaba is right on the corner. Traffic police (known for asking bribes) are approaching. Nobody can move their vehicle until this is resolved. The crowd is getting restless \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they want the road cleared but they also want to see justice. In Karachi, the crowd decides more than the police.\nLast Turns:\nUncle Jameel: Arre, Raza *bhai*! Kya kar rahe ho? Is *saab* ko tang mat karo! Unko Dubai jana hai, kaam hai! Aur tum, tum toh sirf challan likhne ke liye ho! Inspector Farooq mera dost hai, woh tumhein jaanta hai! Poora mohalla jaanta hai Jameel bhai kaun hai! Aslam! Jaldi se do chai, aur ek plate *samosay* bhi le aa! Saab ke liye, aur thoda Raza *bhai* ke liye bhi! Dekho, dekho sab log, yeh police wale bhi sirf paison ke liye hain!\nSaleem: Arre bhai! Dekho toh! Is police wale ko bhi dekho! Saab ko jaane dega, aur mujhe rickshaw ke paise kaun dega? Allah ke liye, zara dekho toh is rickshaw ka haal! Iske andar mere bachchon ka future tha! Crores, crores...mere bachchon ki padhai ke liye bhi nahi hain!\nUncle Jameel: Arre! Ruk jao! Kahan jaa rahe ho, Saab? Itna tezi kyon hai? *Dekho, dekho!* Yeh police wale bhi... zara dekho toh, Saab ko jaane de rahe hain! *Haye Allah!* Is shehar mein koi insaaf nahi hai! Aslam! Jaldi se! Saab ki gaari ke samne baith jao! Rok do usko! Poora mohalla dekha raha hai, Saab! Shame shame!\nAhmed Malik: Dekhiye, Constable Raza sahib, Uncle Jameel is right, I have a flight. It's a very important business meeting. I understand procedure, insurance, challan \u2013 sab theek hai. But time is of the essence. I'm happy to cooperate fully, and to\u2026 facilitate things. A little chai-pani for everyone wouldn't hurt, right? And perhaps a small token of appreciation for your time, Constable?\nSaleem: Arre! Zara dekho toh! Saab ko jaane de rahe hain! Isko police bhi madad kar rahi hai! Allah ke liye, isko mat jaane do! Meri rickshaw ka kya hoga? Paanch bachche bhooke mareinge! Bhaiyon aur behnon, zara dekho toh! Insaaf karo!\nConstable Raza: Oye Saab! Abhi toh shuru hua hai! Five thousand? Itna toh rickshaw ki repair pe bhi nahi hoga! Suno, chabi de! Aur agar dega nahi toh gaari impound kar dunga. Samajha? Aur tum, Uncle Jameel! Chup reh! Tumhara kaam hai chai pilana, police ka kaam!\nUncle Jameel: Arre! *Dekho, dekho!* Raza *bhai*, kya ho raha hai? Is *saab* ko jaane de rahe ho? Poora mohalla dekh raha hai! Inspector Farooq mera dost hai, unko phone karta hoon! *Haye Allah!* Yeh kya zulm hai! Aslam! Jaldi se! Iski gaari ke tyre puncher kar do! Thoda sa drama toh hona chahiye!\nSaleem: Arre bhai! Dekho toh! Yeh police wala Saab ko jaane de raha hai! Insaaf kahaan hai? Allah ke liye, isko mat jaane do! Meri rickshaw ka kya hoga? Bhaiyon aur behnon, zara dekho toh! Is Saab ne meri rickshaw tootwa di hai! Iske bachchon ka kya khayega?\nUncle Jameel: Arre! Yeh kya ho raha hai? Raza *bhai*, tum toh poora *saab* ke ho gaye ho! Inspector Farooq ko phone karta hoon, phir tumhein pata chalega! *Dekho, dekho!* Is aadmi ne rickshaw ko maar di, aur tum usko jaane de rahe ho? Shame shame! Poora Karachi janta hai Jameel bhai kaun hai!\nAhmed Malik: Dekhiye, Constable Raza sahib, I understand your duty. And Uncle Jameel, I respect your concern for Saleem sahib. But this is becoming\u2026 chaotic. I\u2019m a businessman, I deal in facts. Let\u2019s be reasonable. I will personally ensure Saleem sahib receives a fair amount for the damage. But I *must* get to the airport. I\u2019ll even\u2026 I\u2019ll even offer to pay for the challan myself, right now. Just let me make a quick phone call to my office to inform them I\u2019ll be slightly delayed.\n\nWorld State:\n- Saleem Showed Item: True\n- Vehicle Blocked: True\n- Vehicle Blocked Owner: Ahmed Malik\n- Ahmed Malik Called Contact: True\n- Saleem Sitting On Ground: True\n- Keys Confiscated: True\n- Keys Taken From: Ahmed Malik\n- Bribe Offered: True\n- Bribe From: Ahmed Malik\n- Bribe To: Constable Raza\n- Uncle Jameel Called Contact: True\n\nCharacters:\n- Saleem: Poor rickshaw driver, sole earner for family of 5.

    "response": "```json\n{\n    \"should_end\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The story has reached a point where a deal has been struck after multiple rounds of negotiation, a complication (the police involvement and bribe attempts) occurred, all characters have spoken multiple times, and the arguments are becoming repetitive. More than 7 actions have been taken. The resolution feels earned after the escalating tension.\",\n    \"conclusion_narration\": \"Finally, after a tense back-and-forth, Ahmed Malik, exasperated and fearing missing his flight, agreed to pay Saleem 8,000 Rupees for the damage to the rickshaw, and an additional 2,000 Rupees to Constable Raza to \u2018facilitate\u2019 a quick resolution \u2013 a sum Raza happily pocketed, waving Malik through with a curt nod. Saleem, though still grumbling about the inadequacy of the sum, accepted the money, his face softening slightly at the thought of being able to buy some flour and lentils for his family; he immediately began assessing the damage to his rickshaw, already planning a makeshift repair. Ahmed Malik, after a frantic phone call confirming his flight was still holding, sped off towards the airport, leaving a trail of dust and a lingering sense of injustice. Uncle Jameel, beaming with self-importance, returned to his chai dhaba, loudly proclaiming to his customers that he had single-handedly saved the day, while Aslam continued serving chai to the dispersing crowd, the honking of cars slowly returning to its usual chaotic symphony. The dust settled on Shahrah-e-Faisal, the dent in the BMW a silent testament to the day\u2019s drama, and the chai dhaba resumed its business, a small island of normalcy in the relentless current of Karachi life \u2013 a place where even justice has a price, and a cup of chai can smooth over almost any collision.\"\n}\n```",
