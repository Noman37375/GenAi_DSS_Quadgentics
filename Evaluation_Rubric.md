## Evaluation Criteria

| Component | Excellent / Full Marks (Score Range) | Partial / Poor Performance (Score Range) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GitHub Repository & Working System** (25 marks) | System runs successfully using provided instructions. Repository is well-structured; code is clean, modular, and readable. | Repository exists but is poorly organized or difficult to run. The system is partially or fully non-functional. |
| **JSON Files Compliance** (15 marks) | All required input/output JSON files strictly follow the problem statement. Fields are complete, meaningful, and consistent with narrative flow. | Missing, malformed, or inconsistent JSON files. Output does not accurately reflect system execution. |
| **Feature Implementation Beyond Base Design** (15 marks) | Implements all required functionality (actions, memory, reasoning) and introduces meaningful extensions. Features are stable and well-integrated. | Limited or incorrect feature implementation. Little or no improvement beyond the provided base design. |
| **Documentation & Report** (20 marks) | Clear README with setup/usage instructions. Report explains what was built, design decisions, and system mechanics. Demonstrates originality. | Incomplete or unclear documentation. Design decisions are poorly justified or heavily AI-generated without understanding. |
| **Q/A Session with Judges** (15 marks) | Demonstrates strong understanding of system architecture, agent interactions, and design choices. Provides clear justification for decisions. | Unable to clearly explain the system or justify design decisions. |
| **Story Narration Quality** (10 marks) | Narrative is coherent, engaging, and logically structured. Director and agent interactions contribute meaningfully to progression. | Narration lacks coherence or clarity. Story progression is weak or difficult to follow. |

## Notes
* **Subjective Evaluation**: Story Narration Quality is evaluated subjectively, and judges will provide brief written comments to justify the score.
* **System Requirements**: The system must be runnable based on the instructions in your `README.md` to avoid heavy penalties.
